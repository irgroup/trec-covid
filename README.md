## Submission details round #2
1. `irc_bm25_altmetric`:  
This run submission combines a BM25 baseline with altmetrics. The baseline run is retrieved with the default ranker of Elasticsearch/Lucene (BM25) and queries using the contents of the `<query>`, `<question>`, and `<narrative>` tags. We rerank the baseline by adding the logarithmized Altmetric Attention Score.
2. `irc_bm25_logreg_tfidf`:  
This run submission combines a BM25 baseline with a logitistic regression based reranker trained on tfidf-features in combination with relevance judgments of the first round. The baseline run is retrieved with the default ranker of Elasticsearch/Lucene (BM25) and queries using the contents of the `<query>`, `<question>`, and `<narrative>` tags. Topics are reranked if relevance judgments are available (1-30), otherwise the baseline ranking remains unaltered (31-35).

## Submission details round #1

#### Description:
As part of [TREC-COVID](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/), we submit automatic runs based on (pseudo) relevance feedback in combination with a reranking approach.
The reranker is trained on relevance feedback data that is retrieved from PubMed/PubMed Central (PMC). 
The training data is retrieved with queries using the contents of the `<query>` tags only.

For each topic a new reranker is trained. We consider those documents retrieved by the specific topic query as relevant training data,
and the documents of the other 29 topics as non-relevant training data.
Given a baseline run, the trained system reranks documents.

The baseline run is retrieved with the default ranker of Elasticsearch/Lucene ([BM25](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/index-modules-similarity.html)) and queries using the contents of the `<query>` tags only.
For our reranker we use [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) in combination with the [Deep Relevance Matching Model (DRMM)](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/papers/2016/CIKM2016a_guo.pdf).

Our three run submissions differ by the way training data is retrieved from PubMed/PMC.
1. `irc_entrez`:  
The first run is trained on titles and abstracts retrieved from the [Entrez Programming Utilities API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/) with "type=relevance".
2. `irc_pubmed`:   
The second run is trained on titles and abstracts retrieved from [PubMed's search interface](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with "best match". We scrape the PMIDs and retrieve the titles and abstracts afterwards.
3. `irc_pmc`:  
The third run is trained on full text documents retrieved from [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).

## Workflow 
![workflow](doc/workflow.png)
### Setup
Our retrieval pipeline relies on the following dependencies:  
[[docker](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)][[elasticsearch](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/)][[requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)][[beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)][[matchzoo](https://github.com/NTMC-Community/MatchZoo)]

* Install docker. When running on SciComp (Ubuntu VM):  
``` 
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
* Make virtual environment and activate it
``` 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
``` 
* Install requirements:   
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```  
Run `python3` and install nltk data:  
```shell script
python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt
```
* Download data from [semanticscholar](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), extract it and place it in `./data/`. 
``` 
./scripts/getDataSets.sh
``` 
* Fetch data for 30 topics from PubMed (will be written to `artifact` directory with timestamp)
```shell script
python3 scripts/fetchPubmedData.py
```

* Convert embeddings from bin to txt  
```shell script
python3 scripts/convert_word2vec.py
```

* **Optional:** Adapt settings in `config.py`  

### Baseline run 
* Download image and run Elasticsearch container
```shell script
python3 scripts/docker-run.py
```
* Index data  
```shell script
python3 scripts/index.py
```
* Write baseline run file
```shell script
python3 scripts/base.py
```
* **Optional:** Delete the docker container and remove the image  
```shell script
python3 scripts/docker-rm.py
```

### Reranking
* Train model for each of the 30 topics and save models to `./artifact/model/<model-type>`
```shell script
python3 scripts/train.py
```
* Rerank baseline ranking:
```shell script
python3 scripts/rerank.py
```

        Nosocomial transmission is an important characteristic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Risk factors for transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings are not well defined. During the Korean outbreak in 2015, 186 patients had laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Those suspected as a source of viral transmission were categorized into the spreader groups (super-spreader [n = 5] and usual-spreader [n = 10]) and compared to the non-spreader group (n = 171). Body temperature of ≥ 38.5°C (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–22.30;
        <italic>
         P
        </italic>
        = 0.016), pulmonary infiltration of ≥ 3 lung zones (aOR, 7.33; 95% CI, 1.93–27.79;
        <italic>
         P
        </italic>
        = 0.003), and a more nonisolated in-hospital days (aOR, 1.32 per 1 day; 95% CI, 1.09–1.60;
        <italic>
         P
        </italic>
        = 0.004) were significant risk factors in the spreader group. There was no different clinical factor between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders. Nonisolated in-hospital days was the only factor which tended to be higher in super-spreaders than usual-spreaders (Mean, 6.6 vs. 2.9 days;
        <italic>
         P
        </italic>
        = 0.061). Early active quarantine might help reducing the size of an outbreak.

      INTRODUCTION
     </title>
     <p>
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel beta-coronavirus first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       1
      </xref>
      ). It causes severe acute respiratory infection, with a mortality rate of 36% (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
       2
      </xref>
      ). Most MERS-CoV infections occur in the Middle East, although travel-associated MERS cases have been reported in 17 countries outside the Middle East. As of November 3, 2016, 27 countries reported 1,813 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 645 deaths, to the World Health Organization (WHO) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
       2
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Korean outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015, the first known patient was a businessman returning from the Middle East. The outbreak was amplified by super-spreading events at hospitals and movement of patients between hospitals. Spreading events occurred until late June 2015, more than a month after the index patient was identified, resulting in a total of 186 patients with MERS-CoV infection and 38 fatalities, which is the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
       3
      </xref>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
       4
      </xref>
      ). During the outbreak, almost 17,000 individuals at epidemiologic risk were quarantined, and all laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to hospitals for isolation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of MERS-CoV cases, 44%–100% of individual outbreaks were linked to hospitals (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
       5
      </xref>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
       6
      </xref>
      ) and a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV may result in a large cluster of cases, the so called “super-spreading events (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
       6
      </xref>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
       7
      </xref>
      ).” However, it is not known whether the spreading events are attributable to host factors such as clinical manifestations or epidemiologic factors such as duration of the nonisolated period (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
       8
      </xref>
      ). To understand the transmission risk of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings, we assessed the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of non-spreaders, spreaders, and super-spreaders during the Korean outbreak.

       All laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to government-designated hospitals, regardless of the severity of their illness. They were discharged after the resolution of all clinical symptoms and when 2 consecutive daily sputum samples were negative for MERS-CoV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Laboratory diagnoses were made according to the WHO guideline (

       ). Infectious disease specialists who had cared for MERS patients completed case record form which KSID developed. The clinical data included demographics, clinical features, and the results of the laboratory tests. Government daily reports and local Korean news reports on the MERS outbreak were also reviewed (

      <p>
       A spreader was defined as an index patient who was suspected of causing a secondary infection of MERS-CoV. Super-spreaders and usual-spreaders were defined as those who transmitted MERS-CoV to 6 or more and those who transmitted to fewer than 6 individuals, respectively. Nonisolated in-hospital days were defined as the sum of calendar days of the patient's hospital stay before being effectively isolated. Chest radiographs at presentation were analyzed and the number of abnormal lung zones, which were arbitrarily divided into 6 areas, was counted.
      </p>
      <p>
       For subgroup analyses, we censored cases with symptom onset after June 7 after which stricter infection control measures were implemented by the government, such as public disclosure of the names of affected hospitals, organizing rapid response teams, and applying stronger surveillance and isolation policies (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
        12
       </xref>
       ). Healthcare workers were also censored in another subgroup analyses because many wore personal protective equipment, which could also confound the transmission risk.

       Characteristics of 186 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection are shown in
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       . Of them, 15 patients (8.1%) transmitted MERS-CoV (the spreader group) to others, and 171 patients (91.9%) did not (the non-spreader group). Age, sex, and underlying diseases were not different between the 2 groups. Among the spreaders, 5 patients (33.3%) were super-spreaders, while 10 (66.7%) were usual-spreaders. Baseline characteristics of these 2 groups were not significantly different.

       At presentation, patients in the spreader group were more likely than those in the non-spreader group to have a fever of ≥ 38.5°C (40.0% vs. 13.0%,
       <italic>

       = 0.009) and a tachypnea of &gt; 24 breaths per minute (33.3% vs. 12.4%,
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       = 0.034). They were also more likely to have lower respiratory manifestations such as cough, sputum, and dyspnea (86.7% vs. 55.0%,
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       = 0.031; 73.3% vs. 37.3%,

       = 0.001, respectively).
      </p>
      <p>
       On admission, elevated C-reactive protein (≥ 3.0 mg/dL) was the only laboratory parameter that was more common in the spreader than the non-spreader group (85.7% vs. 43.4%,
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       = 0.008). Infiltrates involving 3 or more lung zones on chest radiographs taken at presentation were more common in the spreader group than in the non-spreader group (46.7% vs. 10.3%,
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       &lt; 0.001). The median days from the onset of illness to the negative conversion of sputum MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR were significantly different (27.0 vs. 17.0 days,

        P
       </italic>
       &lt; 0.001).

       Treatment with mechanical ventilation was required in 21.3% (36/169) of the non-spreader group and 60.0% (9/15) of the spreader group (
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       = 0.002). Deaths occurred in 18.1% (31/171) of the non-spreader group and 33.3% (5/15) of the spreader group (
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>

       The course of disease spread could not be determined in 10 patients, including 5 with an unidentified source of infection and 5 with more than one possible scenario. Excluding the first imported case, the courses of disease spread could be determined in 175 patients. Of them, 173 were infected at healthcare facilities (12 hospitals, 3 clinics, and 2 ambulances). The disease was transmitted to 2 remaining patients in household settings. The date of symptom onset could not be determined in 5 patients, including 2 patients who were asymptomatic and 3 with an ambiguous onset of MERS-CoV symptoms during another illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the 15 spreaders, 5 and 8 cases were in the second- and third-chain of transmission, respectively (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">
        Table 2
       </xref>
       ). Spreaders transmitted MERS-CoV from days 1 to 11 of their illness (median, 7 days; interquartile range [IQR], 5 to 8 days) (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
        Fig. 1A
       </xref>
       ). The number of patients infected by each spreader ranged from 1 to 84 (IQR, 1 to 12).

      DISCUSSION
     </title>
     <p>
      Hospital outbreaks were the defining characteristic of the Korean MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015. In this study, spreaders more frequently had high fever, more extensive infiltrates on chest radiographs, and a longer time to negative conversion of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR than non-spreaders, all suggesting more severe pneumonia. The spreader group had a significantly longer duration of nonisolated in-hospital days than the non-spreader groups.
     </p>
     <p>
      Clinical parameters did not differ between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders, whereas nonisolated in-hospital days were substantially different between these 2 groups. These data suggest that large hospital outbreaks or super-spreading events may not be attributable to clinical manifestations, but to delay in isolation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spreaders transmitted MERS-CoV between days 1 and 11 of their illness. Of note, even a 1- or 2-day delay in isolating patients led secondary infections, with a peak of cumulative number on the seventh day of illness. These findings imply that MERS-CoV could be transmitted frequently during the early course of the disease. A recent virus shedding study showed that MERS-CoV titers in sputum samples were around 10
      <sup>

      </sup>
      copies per milliliter as early as 3 days after symptom onset, while the viral shedding kinetics of the SARS-CoV infection was an inverted V shape, with its sharp peak around day 10 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
       13
      </xref>
      ). These findings suggest that control of a MERS-CoV outbreak would be more difficult than that of a SARS-CoV outbreak. Considering that the shortest incubation period of MERS-CoV infection is 2 days and that patients may transmit the disease with a high viral load even in the early course of their illness, early detection and isolation of patients is imperative to control an outbreak of MERS-CoV.
     </p>
     <p>
      A standard approach to control an outbreak begins with identifying all exposed individuals and assessing them for close contact, followed by quarantine. However, this approach is labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially when many individuals are exposed. Moreover, identification of all exposed individuals is difficult, because many, such as visitors and family members, may not be registered with hospitals. Indeed, 43.2% of the patients in Korea during the 2015 outbreak had not been identified as exposed individuals and were not monitored (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
       14
      </xref>
      ). Our experience suggests that quarantining all exposed individuals first, followed by an assessment of and monitoring of their close contacts may shorten the delay in isolating MERS patients, especially in healthcare settings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Days of nonisolated in-hospital stay and symptom onset to diagnosis were significantly longer in patients who developed symptoms before June 7 than in patients who did after that date. The last super-spreader developed symptoms on June 5, and no additional super-spreading events occurred after June 7. All advocate the necessity of early adoption of an aggressive isolation policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since this was an analysis of a single outbreak, it should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, although we analyzed the severity of symptom or chest infiltrations and time to negative conversion of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR, lack of each patient's serial viral load titers limited a direct evaluation of the degree of viral shedding, which could be another limitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In conclusion, high fever, more extensive chest infiltrates, and delay in isolation were associated with the transmission of MERS-CoV. Nonisolated in-hospital days were the only parameter that tended to be associated with super-spreaders compared with usual-spreaders. Early active quarantine might help control a future outbreak of MERS.

        Super-spreading events have been observed in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases. The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea has also shown super-spreading events with a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. It becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of heterogeneity to develop effective intervention strategies and preventive plans for future emerging infectious diseases. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. In the present work, a stochastic agent-based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of heterogeneity. Clinical (i.e., an infectivity level) and social or environmental (i.e., a contact level) heterogeneity are modeled. These factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super-spreaders have stronger transmission and/or higher links. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission.

      1. Introduction
     </title>
     <p>
      The 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) posed a serious public health threat in the Republic of Korea. It generated 186 confirmed cases including 38 fatal cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-15-02369">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. It has drawn a lot of attention not only because it was the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East regions but also because it has been claimed to be a super-spreading event (SSE) similar to the SARS outbreaks in 2003 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-ijerph-15-02369">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. SSE is an outbreak where a small number of infected cases generated a large number of secondary infections [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-15-02369">
       3
      </xref>
      ]; for example, 20% of infectious individuals are responsible for 80% of newly generated infections. Super-spreading events have been observed in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases including SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Singapore [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijerph-15-02369">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. Stein identified the complex interplay among hosts, pathogens and environments for super-spreading events in many infectious diseases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-15-02369">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Furthermore, Shen et al. defined SSE as a patient transmitting a disease to at least eight contacts, based on an analysis of the SARS spread data [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-15-02369">
       6
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      Concerning the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, previous studies have examined whether it was an SSE. Kucharski and Althaus analyzed a large transmission cluster of MERS-CoV in Korea to estimate the level of transmission heterogeneity and identified a substantial potential for super-spreading events [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijerph-15-02369">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. Also, Chun identified that MERS-CoV transmission in Korea was an SSE using a negative binomial model [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-15-02369">
       8
      </xref>
      ]. Kim et al. characterized the transmission dynamics based on a mathematical model and investigated the time-dependent reproduction number [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijerph-15-02369">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. Gerardo et al. performed the comparative analysis between SARS and MERS; they claimed that MERS-CoV in Korea has shown the most significant heterogeneity in generating secondary cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-ijerph-15-02369">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. Nishiura et al. suggested that multiple visits to health facilities were the main cause of the disproportionate number of secondary cases and this might lead the outbreak to be an SSE [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-15-02369">
       10
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      The high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases, which is one of the key evidence of an SSE, can be observed in the time series of cases in 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. In
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02369-f001">
       Figure 1
      </xref>
      , the time series of the 2015 MERS-CoV cases is displayed and classified using five super-spreaders: the five colors represent the different cases according to super-spreader (yellow color is unknown due to multiple contacts). It is clearly seen that there was significant heterogeneity in the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission: five super-spreaders (3%) infected 79% (147/186) of the total MERS-CoV cases. Transmission trees (infection tracing only) for the total 186 MERS-CoV cases are displayed in
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02369-f002">
       Figure 2
      </xref>
      . The node size is proportional to the number of secondary cases (five super-spreaders are identified as in
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02369-f001">
       Figure 1
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Having identified the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea as an SSE, it is necessary to develop a mathematical model that can capture the heterogeneity of infectivity among patients. There have been various approaches to model the SSE in infectious disease transmission dynamics. Firstly, the standard compartmental models have been used. Mkhatshwa and Mummert developed a SIRP model by adding a new superspreader class to a standard SIR model [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-15-02369">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. They assumed that superspreaders have a longer infectious period than normal infected individuals. While their model was simple and clear, a SIR-type model is inherently limited in capturing the individual heterogeneity of attributes, including contact numbers and infectivity. Another way of modeling SSE is a branching process model. In each discrete time step, an infected individual produces a random number of secondary infections that follows a certain probability distribution. There are a small number of cases whose value is far from the mean and these are used to model super-spreaders. Lloyd-Smith et al. employed a negative binomial distribution and defined an SSE where any single patient infects more than the
      <italic>
       n
      </italic>
      th percentile of the distribution [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-15-02369">
       12
      </xref>
      ]. James, Pitchford and Plank suggested three branching process models, each of whose random variable follows a different probability distribution [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-15-02369">
       13
      </xref>
      ]. Garske and Rhodes suggested a branching process model implemented in continuous time instead of discrete generation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-15-02369">
       14
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to these methods, agent-based modeling (ABM) can be a useful tool in modeling SSEs. Due to the dramatic increase in computing power and its strength in modeling individual heterogeneity, it has been employed in modeling various aspects of infectious disease transmission dynamics especially in modeling SSEs with spatio-temporal factors. In ABM, SSEs are usually modeled by incorporating a small number of agents (super-spreaders) who can generate a larger number of secondary infections than normal agents. There are a few ways to implement these super-spreaders. The first way is to make them have an inherently higher level of infectivity [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-15-02369">
       14
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijerph-15-02369">
       15
      </xref>
      ]: this corresponds to the higher transmission rate in a mathematical model. Another way is to make the infectious period of super-spreaders longer while the infectivity is same with normal agents [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-15-02369">
       11
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-15-02369">
       14
      </xref>
      ]. The last way is to make the number of contacts of super-spreader larger than the number of normal agents while the infectivity remains same [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijerph-15-02369">
       16
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijerph-15-02369">
       17
      </xref>
      ]. Each of these ways pays attention to different aspects of the super-spreaders and can be useful for capturing and analyzing SSEs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In particular, a group of studies has employed ABM in modeling SSEs from the perspective of the contact network. Fujie and Odagaki developed agent-based models on an irregular lattice network and suggested two kinds of models in their work; a strong infectiousness model and a hub model [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijerph-15-02369">
       15
      </xref>
      ]. Comparing the results of two models with SARS transmission data in Hong Kong, they concluded that the hub model provides a closer match with the real-world data. Small, Tse and Walker suggested a small-world network model where individuals have local links that connect to immediate neighbors and non-local links that connect to far-away nodes [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijerph-15-02369">
       16
      </xref>
      ]. They represented the former as contact with the family and the latter as contact made in public spaces. Bifolchi, Deardon and Feng simulated the epidemic spreads through various contact networks to determine which model best predicts the true probabilities of infection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijerph-15-02369">
       17
      </xref>
      ]. Duan et al. suggested an elaborate agent-based model that incorporates a variety of features of agent behaviors that might generate SSE including heterogeneous levels of infectivity and contacts [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-ijerph-15-02369">
       18
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>

      The present research aims to develop stochastic agent-based models of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission dynamics in South Korea. Embracing the power of ABM, heterogeneities among agents are implemented in the models. In particular, regular-spreaders and super-spreaders are set to have different transmission rate functions based on different transmission probabilities and a different number of contacts. Based on these heterogeneities, four models are suggested: no super-spreader model (No-SS), the super-spreaders model with higher infectivity (SSM1), the super-spreaders model with higher contacts (SSM2), and super-spreaders model with both higher infectivity and higher contacts (SSM3). Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios and the results are compared with the real epidemic data of 2015 MERS-CoV in Korea. The distributions of the basic reproduction number and epidemic outputs are computed as well as the distribution of secondary cases under different models of super-spreaders. Furthermore, the effectiveness of isolation intervention strategies and their impact on the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics are investigated.

       . We define two types of transmission rate functions for regular-spreaders and super-spreaders. Here, super-spreaders are assumed to have either a higher transmission probability or larger number of contacts than regular spreaders (three different models for super-spreaders will be described below).

       Clearly, the effect of super-spreaders makes the disease transmission faster and more severe (see SSM3 in both panels) since super-spreaders in SSM3 have a stronger transmission and longer effective radius than the other models (in order of SSM3 &gt; SSM2 &gt; SSM1 &gt; No-SS). This becomes more profound under a higher proportion of super-spreaders in the right panel (

      <p>
       Higher peak size, faster peak time, and earlier epidemic durations are the common features of SSE, which is consistent with the results under SSM3 as shown in the above epidemic outputs. This is due to the larger number of contacts and higher transmission rates resulting in the larger epidemic peak in a shorter period of time.

As the proportion of super-spreaders gets larger, the peak size becomes larger and the peak time earlier in SSM2 and SSM3, while it does not have a remarkable impact in SSM1. This suggests that a longer effective radius makes the disease spread easier. Lastly, we investigated the effect of the exponent term

       3.4. The Impact of Super-Spreaders on Distributions of Secondary Cases
      </title>
      <p>
       As observed in many infectious diseases, we explore the distributions of secondary cases under four models. Again, 1000 simulations for each model have been carried out and the mean distributions are obtained.

       illustrates the mean distribution of the number of links under each model. In the absence of super-spreaders, No-SS shows monotone decreases in the number of links (the most homogeneous in four model outputs with the shortest tail from zero to six) (a). As the transmission rates become stronger and the number of contacts increases, the heterogeneity becomes more severe (in order of SSM3 &gt; SSM2 &gt; SSM1 &gt; No-SS). As shown in (d), SSM3 exhibits the highest level of heterogeneity in the secondary cases (the highest frequency at zero and also the largest right tail). This is consistent with the results of the basic reproduction number, as shown in

       3.5. The Impact of Isolation Intervention Strategies
      </title>
      <p>
       Lastly, we investigate the impact of isolation interventions on the MERS-CoV dynamics. Two distinct isolation strategies are implemented: a random and a targeted intervention. First, a random intervention isolates individuals (20% randomly chosen; both regular and super-spreaders) from the S and E classes at

       day. Second, a targeted intervention isolates individuals (super-spreaders only starting from
       <inline-formula>
        <mml:math id="mm67">

       day until the end of epidemic duration) from the E and I classes. Here, a targeted isolation intervention means an individual is isolated and either has effective contact with infected individuals (exposed) or is infected by super-spreaders. The results under the three models (SSM1, SSM2 and SSM3) are displayed in
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02369-f012">
        Figure 12

       . In all three models, a random selection reduces the peak size proportionally, resulting in a longer epidemic duration (red incidence curves in (a), (b), (c)).
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that a targeted isolation reduces the peak size significantly at the beginning which can delay the highest peak and result in more preparation time (green incidence curves in (b), (c)). The implementation of targeted isolation while incapable of eliminating a possible outbreak, still manages to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak by distributing both the infection cases and hospitalization over a broader window of time. Distributing the MERS-CoV case burden over long windows in time is highly desirable when resources are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       A targeted intervention is more effective in both SSM2 and SSM3, while a random intervention is more effective in SSM1. It is worth noting that the effectiveness of interventions depends on the infected-network structures. These results suggest that the effectiveness of interventions depends on the characteristics of the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics. Hence, it highlights the roles of super-spreaders in the transmission dynamics of infectious disease and planning future interventions.

      4. Discussions
     </title>
     <p>
      In this study, we built a stochastic agent-based model on the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea from the perspective of SSE. The outbreak was an SSE: almost 80% of 186 confirmed cases were infected by five super-spreaders (147/186). Surprisingly, one super-spreader alone infected 53% of the MERS-CoV cases via other super-spreaders (79/147). To devise effective intervention strategies and countermeasures for future emerging infectious diseases, it is necessary to clarify the generating mechanism of SSEs. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. The present research developed and analyzed agent-based models with different assumptions concerning the feature of super-spreaders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our results indicate that the connectivity of individuals and a higher level of infectivity are the most significant factors for the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics. The effect of super-spreaders was not remarkably significant in SSM1, but it was in SSM2 and SSM3. The higher baseline transmission rate and the longer contact range produced a more rapid and severe disease spread in SSM2 and SSM3 than in SSM1. Due to the features of super-spreaders, the real-world data demonstrated the best fit with SSM3 compared to SSM1 or SSM2. The impact of the effective radius on the basic reproduction number

      and secondary cases while No-SS gave the least heterogeneity. All results above suggest that SSE can be more properly characterized by a small number of infectious individuals who can infect others by means of a larger amount of contact with others combined with higher infectivity. Having only one feature (either higher infectivity or higher connectivity) is not strong enough to generate such a high level of heterogeneity in secondary cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effectiveness of two isolation strategies was examined: a random isolation reduced incidence proportionally while a targeted isolation reduced the peak size and delayed the peak time. A targeted isolation was more effective in both SSM2 and SSM3 while a random isolation was more effective in SSM1. These results suggest that the effectiveness of intervention strategies is dependent on the structure of the infection network. However, super-spreaders can be identified in retrospectively; it is very challenging to predict SSEs or super-spreaders. Thus, a targeted isolation intervention might be idealistic to be implemented. Nevertheless, we can investigate the most critical factors for generating SSEs and these factors can provide how to devise effective intervention strategies as discussed in [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-15-02369">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-15-02369">
       22
      </xref>
      ]. For instance, various factors include co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. These factors are worthy of investigation and should be incorporated into targeted intervention strategies. Our results showed that even when early detection was unsuccessful, it is still effective to find possible candidates for super-spreaders and isolate them to reduce potential risks of severe outbreaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the limitations of this research lies in the shape of the space where the simulations were executed. Although it is well known that infectious disease transmission dynamics depends on the structure of the infection network, we based our model on a random network in order to focus on the effect of super-spreaders on disease transmission. Despite this simplification, our results from a simple random network clearly demonstrated the role of super-spreaders on disease transmission and the possible effective intervention scenarios. Further studies are expected to conduct epidemic models based on other network structures, especially more realistic ones. For example, using the empirical contact network of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea would make the simulated space more realistic. Also, the effectiveness of more various intervention strategies and possible epidemic scenarios can be explored in future research.

      5. Conclusions
     </title>
     <p>
      We developed an agent-based model that can provide a general mathematical tool for any disease outbreaks with super-spreading events. Super-spreading events in the transmission dynamics of 2015 MERS-CoV showed a high level of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in transmission patterns are one of the most critical factors for infectious disease transmission dynamics. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission. Having only one feature (either higher infectivity or higher connectivity) is not strong enough to generate such a high level of heterogeneity in secondary cases.

        Summary

       <p>
        We evaluated the epidemiological risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission during the recent South Korean outbreak. MERS-CoV transmission was determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts, whereas super-spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits.

         Background.
        </title>
        <p>
         Transmission heterogeneity was observed during the 2015 Korean outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Only 22 of 186 cases transmitted the infection, and 5 super-spreading events caused 150 transmissions. We investigated the risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission.

         Methods.
        </title>
        <p>
         Epidemiological reports were used to classify patients as nonspreaders, spreaders, or those associated with a super-spreading event (5 or more transmissions). Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors for MERS-CoV transmission.

         Results.
        </title>
        <p>
         Compared to nonspreaders, spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation (7 days vs 3 days) and more frequent pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses (68.2% vs 17.1%). Spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (149 vs 17.5), pre-isolation hospitalization (68.2% vs 16.5%), and emergency room (ER) visits (50% vs 7.3%). Spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the

         and
         <italic>
          ORF1a
         </italic>
         genes (22.7 vs 27.2 and 23.7 vs 27.9, respectively). In multivariate analysis, transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.96) and pre-isolation hospitalization or ER visits (OR, 6.82; 95% CI, 2.06–22.84). The super-spreading events exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (777 vs 78), pre-isolation ER visits (100% vs 35.3%), and doctor shopping (100% vs 47.1%) compared to non-super-spreading events.

         Conclusions.
        </title>
        <p>
         These findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts, whereas super-spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits. These relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks.

     ]. Transmission heterogeneity describes a state in which most transmissions are related to a few patients and most patients do not transmit the disease. Numerous other infectious diseases exhibit transmission heterogeneity [

     ], and this concept is important for understanding epidemics. The course of an epidemic is influenced by the basic reproduction number (R
     <sub>

     = the average number of cases that 1 case produces in a susceptible population) and transmission heterogeneity [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
      3
     </xref>
     ]. As R
     <sub>
      0
     </sub>
     represents an average quantity, it is often insufficient to explain individual variation, and as transmission heterogeneity reflects individual variation, it can help predict the likelihood of super-spreading events. Even in instances with a low R
     <sub>

     </sub>
     , a disease with high transmission heterogeneity (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) can cause super-spreading events [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">
      2
     </xref>
     ], such as the super-spreading that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak [

     Transmission heterogeneity was observed during early MERS-CoV outbreaks [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">
      1
     </xref>
     ] and became prominent during the 2015 South Korean outbreak. Among the 186 confirmed Korean cases of MERS-CoV infection, &gt;80% of the transmissions were epidemiologically associated with 5 patients [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">
      5
     </xref>
     ], and almost 90% of the cases caused no transmission. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that MERS has greater transmission heterogeneity compared to SARS [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">
      6
     </xref>
     ]. Therefore, to successfully control MERS-CoV infection, it is essential to identify high-risk patients and perform targeted infection control [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">
      2
     </xref>
     ]. However, these patients are difficult to identify, as an individual’s infectiousness is affected by complex interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment. Several researchers have attempted to identify risk factors for super-spreading events during the SARS outbreak [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">

     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">

     ], although there is little information regarding the high-risk group(s) from the MERS-CoV outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recent South Korean MERS-CoV outbreak was triggered by a single imported case, and epidemiological tracing was performed for all laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">

     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">

     ]. Thus, it is possible to precisely reconstruct the transmission chain and identify patients who transmitted MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics that were associated with MERS-CoV transmission and super-spreading events.

       Cases of MERS-CoV infection were confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, regardless of their clinical manifestations. The epidemiological reports were analyzed by epidemic intelligence service officers who participated in the MERS-CoV outbreak investigation. When a case was exposed to multiple confirmed cases, the transmission was attributed to the case with the highest likelihood of transmission, and any conflicts were resolved through the consensus of the epidemic intelligence service officers. Spreaders were defined as confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection that were epidemiologically suspected of transmitting MERS-CoV to 1 or more persons. Super-spreading events were arbitrarily defined as transmission of MERS-CoV infection to 5 or more cases. The patient who triggered the outbreak was defined as patient zero. Cases that were infected by patient zero were defined as first-generation cases; cases that were infected by first-generation cases were defined as second-generation cases; and cases that were infected by second-generation cases were defined as third-generation cases [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">
        14
       </xref>
       ]. Isolation was defined as separating symptomatic patients from others to prevent spreading, and quarantine was defined as separating or restricting the movement of healthy individuals who may have been exposed to the infection within the maximum incubation period. The transmission date was defined as the date of contact between the spreader and suspected secondary case during the spreader’s infectious period. In cases with an exposure duration of longer than 1 day, the transmission date was defined as the day with the highest likelihood of transmission or as the median day during the exposure period in cases with consistent contact throughout the exposure. The date of sampling was the day on which the first positive respiratory specimen was collected. Close contacts were defined using the Guidelines on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">
        15

       ], which include persons who stayed in a room or ward with a confirmed case, who directly contacted respiratory secretions from confirmed cases, or who stayed within 2 m from the confirmed cases without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses were based on radiographic evidence. Doctor shopping was defined as visiting multiple healthcare facilities without an official interhospital transfer after developing MERS-CoV symptoms [

      <p>
       Epidemiological reports from the outbreak were evaluated to collect data regarding basic demographic characteristics, medical history, MERS-CoV exposure, symptoms and their onset date(s), sampling date(s), contact history, and post-exposure infection control. The reports were drafted during the outbreak based on direct interviews with the confirmed cases and follow-up epidemiological investigations that were performed to identify the exposure route and close contacts. Hospital information systems were reviewed to identify patients who stayed in the hospital during the exposure period and healthcare providers who contacted the patient(s). Persons who contacted confirmed cases outside healthcare facilities were also traced. Data from closed circuit television, credit card transactions, and health insurance services were also reviewed [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">

       We identified 186 cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patient zero infected 28 first-generation cases. Among the 28 cases, 8 were responsible for transmission to 121 second-generation cases. Among the 121 cases, 12 infected 30 third-generation cases. One patient with an unclear source of infection (case 119) transmitted the infection to another patient. Four patients exhibited unclear sources of transmission (cases 43, 178, 184, and 185). Each confirmed case transmitted the infection to 0–83 secondary cases (

       The Spreaders’ Epidemiological Characteristics
      </title>
      <p>
       After excluding the 5 cases with unclear infection sources, we identified 180 transmissions generated by 22 spreaders. A total of 150 transmission events (83.3%) were epidemiologically linked to the 5 super-spreading events. Twenty-five transmission events (13.9%) occurred within 3 days after symptom onset, 136 transmissions (75.6%) occurred 4–7 days after symptom onset, and 19 transmissions (10.6%) occurred &gt;7 days after symptom onset. A total of 170 transmission events (94.4%) occurred on the day of or after a radiographically confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia. A total of 173 transmissions (96.1%) occurred before appropriate in-hospital isolation. Seven transmissions (3.9%) occurred between confirmed cases and healthcare personnel after in-hospital isolation: 4 (cases164, 169, 181, and 183) were doctors or nurses who managed confirmed cases, 1 (case148) participated in cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a confirmed case, 1 (case 162) involved portable radiography for a confirmed case, and 1 (case 179) rode in an ambulance with a confirmed case during a hospital transfer.

        Table 2

       ). In the univariate analyses, transmission was associated with underlying respiratory disease, Ct value, interval from symptom onset to diagnosis, number of contacts, and pre-isolation hospitalization or ER visits. In the multivariate analyses, transmission was independently associated with a low Ct value for

      DISCUSSION
     </title>
     <p>
      We evaluated the epidemiological characteristics of patients who transmitted MERS-CoV during the recent South Korean outbreak. Among the 186 confirmed MERS-CoV cases, only 22 cases transmitted the infection to other individuals. These spreaders had higher host infectivity and wider and prolonged contacts compared to nonspreaders. The risk factors for super-spreading events included a larger number of contacts and a pre-isolation ER visit. Doctor shopping was marginally associated with a super-spreading event. However, both spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions exhibited similar levels of host infectivity. It appears that both host infectivity and the number of contacts influenced MERS-CoV transmission, whereas super-spreading events were mostly associated with a greater likelihood of encountering other people under diverse environmental conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the 2015 outbreak, approximately 75% of the transmissions occurred during days 4–7 after symptom onset, and this may be a period when the risk of transmission is particularly high. Furthermore, this high-risk period was temporally associated with other epidemiological factors. First, the period overlapped with the confirmed cases’ visits to healthcare facilities, as hospitalization and ER visits peaked during days 4–7 after symptom onset. It is well known that MERS-CoV outbreaks generally occur in the healthcare setting [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">
       1
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">
       20
      </xref>
      ], and the high-risk period may be associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors. Second, the high-risk period was several days (1–4 days) after the radiographic diagnoses of pneumonia, which generally occurred on days 3–4 after symptom onset. Although the significance of pre-isolation pneumonia has not been discussed previously, a radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia may influence transmission in 2 ways. First, it may directly increase the chance of transmission by actively generating lower respiratory tract secretions and a productive cough. Second, it may be an indirect index of disease severity and hospital visiting status. In our study, cases with pre-isolation pneumonia had lower Ct values and more frequent pre-isolation hospital visits.
     </p>
     <p>
      The epidemiological significance of the high-risk period could also be observed when we compared the spreaders and nonspreaders. The spreaders were typically isolated after the high-risk period (median, 7 days after symptom onset and 4 days after a diagnosis of pneumonia), whereas nonspreaders were typically isolated before this period (median, 3 days after symptom onset and 1 day after a diagnosis of pneumonia). Similar results were observed in a study of the SARS outbreak, which revealed that late admission to healthcare facilities (especially &gt;4 days after symptom onset) was associated with super-spreading events [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. Thus, infection prevention measures should target isolation before this critical period (ie, within 4–7 days after symptom onset and within 1 day after the detection of pneumonia). Interestingly, the average duration from symptom onset to isolation dropped to &lt;4 days during the first week of June 2015, and reports of new cases have rapidly decreased since that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among the host factors that were associated with transmission, only the Ct value was statistically significant in the multivariate analyses. The Ct value is a semiquantitative continuous variable that is inversely proportional to the viral load. Ct values are associated with the severity of MERS-CoV infection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">
       22
      </xref>
      ], although its relationship with transmission has rarely been studied. In the present study, spreaders had significantly lower Ct values compared to nonspreaders, which suggests that Ct values might reliably predict transmission. Moreover, the cases with very low Ct values (Ct &lt;23) tended to transmit the infection in uncommon circumstances. In both the present study and previous studies, MERS-CoV transmission usually occurred in the hospital setting [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">
       1
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">
       11
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">
       13
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">
       23
      </xref>
      ]. In contrast, cases with very low Ct values transmitted the infection in more diverse settings in the present outbreak (eg, their household, in an ambulance, in an outpatient clinic, or to healthcare personnel after in-hospital isolation). These findings suggest that cases with very low Ct values can potentially transmit the infection in unexpected conditions. However, our data regarding the Ct values have several limitations. First, various amounts of phosphate-buffered saline were added to dilute the respiratory specimens, and this may have affected the Ct values. Second, the Ct value is influenced by the specimen type and the interval between symptom onset and sample collection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">
       22
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">
       24
      </xref>
      ], but various different types of specimens were collected at different time points in the present study. However, we only evaluated 5 nonsputum specimens, and there was no linear correlation between the Ct values and the interval from onset to sampling.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our comparison of the spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions revealed that the spreaders with 5 or more transmissions had an approximately 10-fold higher number of contacts. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in host infectivity. These findings may suggest that the underlying likelihood of transmission has the greatest influence on super-spreading events rather than an intrinsic difference in host infectivity. A similar finding was observed in a previous study of the SARS super-spreading event [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">
       4
      </xref>
      ], with those super-spreaders having 11–74 contacts compared to 1–4 contacts for the spreaders with 1–2 transmissions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our study also revealed that a pre-isolation ER visit and doctor shopping were associated with super-spreading events. In addition, super-spreading events were associated with the number of healthcare facilities that each patient visited for hospitalization or ER treatment but not with the number of hospitals visited for outpatient treatment. In South Korea, patients who seek hospitalization without prior arrangements tend to visit the ER, and a history of 2 or more ER visits strongly suggests that the patient had been doctor shopping during hospitalization. Specific environmental conditions have been suggested to increase the likelihood of a super-spreading event [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
       3
      </xref>
      ], and doctor shopping may increase the likelihood of encountering these conditions. For example, when a confirmed case changes hospital during hospitalization without an official interhospital transfer, multiple environments are exposed to the infected case (an ambulance, an ER, and a ward). Thus, doctor shopping can greatly increase the likelihood of encountering conditions that are suitable for a super-spreading event. In the present outbreak, 4 of the 5 super spreaders (cases 1, 14, 16, and 76) transmitted the infection at 2 or more hospitals, as they had visited multiple healthcare facilities. Therefore, it is very important to have an early suspicion of MERS-CoV infection and minimize doctor shopping during the early stage of an outbreak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our study has several limitations. First, some of the confirmed cases had multiple potential sources of infection, and we attributed the transmission to the case with the highest epidemiological probability. The source of infection was clear in &gt;95% of the transmissions, and we excluded 3 cases that had contact with multiple cases and an unclear source of transmission. However, as the analyses of the epidemiological data are ongoing, the list of spreaders may change if new epidemiological evidence is uncovered. Second, we did not have access to genomic sequencing data, which might have provided information regarding the relatedness of transmitted strains. Third, transmission may be affected by other epidemiological factors, including aerosol-generating procedures, differences in environmental conditions, and variations in crowdedness [

      ]. However, these factors were not included in the present analysis. Fourth, serological testing was not performed for every close contact, and additional asymptomatic cases may have been present. However, the seropositive rate was 0.7% in a recent serological study of close contacts [

      We evaluated the epidemiological risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission during the recent South Korean outbreak. Super-spreading events were not related to intrinsic host characteristics and were attributable to the likelihood of transmission. Therefore, strict ER triage and minimizing doctor shopping during an outbreak’s early stage may help prevent super-spreading events.

       Introduction
      </title>
      <p id="p0010">
       A number of recent virus outbreaks have resulted in rapid virus spread, placing demands on the affected health infrastructures and sparking global concern. In September 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged as a novel virus that can result in severe respiratory disease with renal failure, with a case fatality rate of up to 38%. Primary infections typically occur in countries located in the Middle East, where dromedary camels have been identified as one of the species harboring the virus. However, travel has contributed to several cases in other countries. Notably, between May and July 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV centered in South Korea killed 36 people out of 186 confirmed cases (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">
        Promedmail.org, 2015
       </xref>
       ), with thousands quarantined as health authorities attempted to control virus spread.
      </p>
      <p id="p0015">
       Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a close relative of MERS-CoV, was the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak centered around Guangdong Province in the southeast of China. The SARS-CoV outbreak killed 774 and infected 8,096 people between November 2002 and July 2003, for a case fatality rate of 9.6%, in which the virus was first traced to palm civets, and then bats. Over 80% of the total cases and deaths were from mainland China and Hong Kong.
      </p>
      <p id="p0020">
       More recently, a devastating Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak has swept through Western Africa. EBOV is a filovirus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with up to a 90% case fatality rate if untreated. Outbreaks of EBOV are sporadic, unpredictable, and localized to sub-Saharan Africa. Prior to the 2014–15 outbreak, a total of 1,093 deaths out of 1,393 infections were documented dating back to 1976, when EBOV first emerged. The natural reservoir of EBOV is currently unknown, but fruit bats are suspected to be the animal species harboring the virus.
      </p>
      <p id="p0025">
       In addition to their significant impact, these outbreaks were all perpetuated by super-spreaders who disproportionately infect a high number of contacts and likely contribute to the speed and degree of the outbreak. As discussed in detail below, these outbreaks can be traced to one or more individuals who largely contributed to subsequent infections.

       Super-Spreaders in the MERS-CoV Outbreak in South Korea
      </title>
      <p id="p0030">
       The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea began from an imported case, a 68-year-old male with a recent travel history to several Middle Eastern countries, including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The latter three countries also had reported human cases of MERS-CoV during the same period of time. After the patient started exhibiting disease symptoms, he sought medical assistance at several clinics before being admitted to a hospital, where he was confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">
        WHO, 2015a
       </xref>
       ). Twenty-nine secondary infections have since been directly traced to this index patient. Additionally, two of these secondary cases were shown to be responsible for 106 subsequent infections, out of 166 known cases at the time (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">
        Cowling et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Transmission was mostly within nosocomial settings, and fourth generation infections have been documented for the first time since the virus was identified in 2012. Thus, the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea was driven primarily by three infected individuals, and approximately 75% of cases can be traced back to three super-spreaders who have each infected a disproportionately high number of contacts (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">
        Figure 1
       </xref>
       A). This MERS-CoV outbreak is the second largest on record and the largest outside of the Middle East. The MERS-CoV outbreak currently appears to be under control, with no additional infections reported in South Korea since July 4, 2015.

       The SARS-CoV Outbreak
      </title>
      <p id="p0035">
       Retrospectively, several super-spreading events were also documented during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003. The index patient of the Hong Kong epidemic was treated at Prince of Wales Hospital and was associated with at least 125 secondary cases (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">
        Riley et al., 2003
       </xref>
       ). Subsequent super-spreader events occurred at the Hotel Metropole (13 cases) and the Amoy Gardens housing complex (over 180 cases) in Hong Kong and aboard an Air China flight traveling from Hong Kong to Beijing (22 cases) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">
        Braden et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). Notably, cases from Hotel Metropole were responsible for the spread of SARS-CoV to Canada, Vietnam, and Singapore through travel (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">

       Have Super-Spreaders Played a Role in Other Outbreaks?

      <p id="p0040">
       To a lesser extent, similar events were observed with the 2014-15 EBOV outbreak, centered in the Western African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Epidemiological work has linked five infections with a 2-year-old toddler in the remote village of Meliandou, Guinea. One of the contacts, a midwife, infected at least three others, including a hospital worker at Guéckédou hospital. This worker then infected several family members in the Guéckédou Farako district, as well as 15 others at Macenta hospital (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
        Baize et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). One of the subsequent cases, a doctor, was known to have infected several others who traveled to Kissidougou and Nzérékoré, further propagating virus transmission (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
        Baize et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). The outbreak eventually spilled over to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, the funeral of a traditional healer that died from EBOV was shown to have directly infected 13 others (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">
        Gire et al., 2014

       ) and was eventually linked to more than 300 cases (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">
        WHO, 2015b
       </xref>
       ). The EBOV outbreak has killed 11,284 people, with 27,741 infected as of July 19 2015, en route to becoming the largest filovirus outbreak ever documented. In addition to EBOV, super-spreading has also been documented in outbreaks with other pathogens, including measles (

       Why Is the Super-Spreader Phenomenon Important?
      </title>
      <p id="p0045">
       The initial stages of the outbreaks mentioned above involved at least one super-spreading event. The ability of the pathogen to infect subsequent super-spreaders who may export the disease through travel is likely the difference between an infection cluster and an outbreak or epidemic (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">
        Figure 1
       </xref>
       C). Differences in the initial response to MERS-CoV is why South Korea reported clusters of infections before bringing the virus under control and why China, Thailand, and the Philippines have not reported any additional cases despite imported MERS-CoV infections. It was why SARS-CoV was so devastating in mainland China and Hong Kong from 2002 to 2003. It was also why the 2014–15 EBOV outbreak spiraled out of control in Western Africa, with hundreds of new cases reported weekly, before a coordinated international effort (including contact tracing, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment of infected patients, as well as community education) brought the number down to a more manageable 20–30 weekly infections, with most of the cases diagnosed in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Early discovery, diagnosis, intervention, and quarantine of confirmed cases is crucial for preventing further disease transmission in humans, especially via super-spreaders. As evidenced by the decreased numbers of new cases in the MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks, current responses are effective, provided that the measures are implemented properly and followed strictly. Vigilance and patience will be necessary until the ongoing MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks are officially at an end.

       Approaches or Guidelines that Can Proactively Identify Super-Spreaders
      </title>
      <p id="p0050">
       Currently, super-spreaders are only retrospectively categorized after epidemiological tracing. Given their high propensity to spread infection, super-spreaders should be able to shed higher levels of pathogen and/or for a longer period of time after infection. This would increase the probability that the pathogen contacts and subsequently infects a naive host.
      </p>
      <p id="p0055">
       To address whether there are factors or parameters that promote or indicate enhanced virus shedding in a laboratory setting, an animal species that closely recapitulates symptoms of the human disease is required, such that any findings can be translated to humans. Animals could be experimentally infected with different virus strains/variants at varying doses via different challenge routes, in which virus shedding from the oral, nasal, and rectal cavities should be correlated with different parameters, including viremia or virus titers in the organs. However, these studies are currently challenging for SARS-CoV as there is currently not an appropriate animal model that replicates the severe disease seen in humans; infected nonhuman primates exhibit variable, but at most mild to moderate, respiratory disease (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">
        McAuliffe et al., 2004
       </xref>
       ) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
        Lawler et al., 2006
       </xref>
       ). Nonetheless, these types of studies are feasible for MERS-CoV. A model of this infection was developed in the common marmoset that results in severe respiratory disease and partial lethality, in which live virus can be detected in nasal and throat swabs of infected animals (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">
        Falzarano et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). Thus, the studies proposed above can be investigated with MERS-CoV in this animal model.
      </p>
      <p id="p0060">
       For EBOV, the cynomolgus and rhesus macaque animal models are well characterized and have been used over the past 20+ years. EBOV shedding is known to occur from the oral, nasal, and/or rectal cavities of nonhuman primates during the advanced stages of disease, but factors that influence virus shedding from these animals have not yet been investigated. Interestingly, using a guinea pig model, it was shown that animals infected intranasally (i.n.) with guinea pig-adapted EBOV were more contagious to naive contact animals than those that were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the same dose (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">
        Wong et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). I.n. infected animals shed virus from their nasal cavity earlier than their i.p. counterparts, and i.p. challenged animals died earlier (and thus were removed from contact with naive animals) compared to i.n. inoculated guinea pigs. It was therefore concluded that the route of infection in addition to the duration of contact time with an infectious host may be factors that influence the efficiency of virus transmission. It will take time to elucidate all possible host and viral factors that contribute to virus shedding, which remains an understudied topic to date. Therefore, it is not currently possible to predict with any level of confidence or statistical significance whether a person will become a super-spreader of a certain disease. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of super-spreaders might provide some clues about the genetic backgrounds of super-spreaders, but the feasibility and robustness of these analyses will depend on the number of super-spreaders in a given outbreak.

       Additional Approaches to Study Risk Factors behind Super-Spreading
      </title>
      <p id="p0065">
       The large amount of patient data and samples available from the recent MERS-CoV and EBOV outbreaks provide possible opportunities to investigate factors that may correlate with an increased risk for becoming a super-spreader. Using the MERS-CoV outbreak as an example, detailed records were kept for the majority of patients who were confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV. Since the identities of the three super-spreaders are known as Patients #1, #14, and #16, studies can be performed to investigate whether these three patients have common traits (i.e., age, gender, pre-existing medical conditions or underlying co-morbidities, levels of virus shedding, etc.). Any common characteristics can then be compared with non-super-spreader patients to provide insight into possible risk factors behind enhanced spreading of infectious diseases.
      </p>
      <p id="p0070">
       Another approach would be to isolate MERS-CoV from the three known super-spreaders, perform sequence analysis of the viral genomes, and determine whether there are any shared mutations between these isolates. Any mutations that are identified and are absent from the viral genomes of other patients could be indicators of enhanced virus shedding, allowing for super-spreading to occur.

       Concluding Remarks
      </title>
      <p id="p0075">
       A complex combination of factors likely plays a role in the number of subsequent infections initiating from a single super-spreader. In addition to host and virus factors, other important factors impacting the spread of infectious diseases are the environment and behavior of individuals. Environmental factors include the close proximity of other susceptible hosts and the airflow dynamics within an enclosed area. A high population density represents a greater number of susceptible hosts for direct/indirect contact with an infected person, whereas air re-circulation would especially facilitate the transmission of airborne viruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Hospitals, enclosed housing complexes, and mass transportation, such as airplanes, are documented sites of super-spreader events, especially during the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ). Individual behaviors may also enhance disease spread. These include “doctor shopping”—going to multiple hospitals to treat the same ailments or traveling to other countries after the appearance of disease symptoms, which was observed with the MERS-CoV outbreak (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">
        Su et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Traditional customs, such as unsafe funerals/burials in Africa, which involve direct contact with infectious bodily fluids of patients that passed away from EBOV disease, is another major reason why the outbreak persisted in Guinea and Sierra Leone (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ). A thorough study of host, virus, and environmental dynamics will be important to delineate the relative contribution of each factor to the phenomenon of super-spreading. Findings from these studies, combined with changes in behavior conducive to the spread of disease, will be important for the effective management of and preparation for future outbreaks.

         Background
        </title>
        <p>
         Since the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea was reported on 20
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         May 2015, there have been 186 confirmed cases, 38 deaths and 16,752 suspected cases. Previously published research on South Korea's MERS outbreak was limited to the early stages, when few data were available. Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate.

         Data were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association. Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation. Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths.

         Findings
        </title>
        <p>
         Beginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted. The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years. As in most other countries, more men than women were affected. The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%). In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections. The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension. The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’. The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.

      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is becoming an increasing threat to global health security, much like Ebola or swine flu.

      Domestic and international media sources attributed the spread of MERS in South Korea to many factors. Reuters reported that South Korea's MERS situation would not be abated without information transparency and cooperation with international virus hunters, pointing out the South Korean Government's refusal to seek help from international parties as particularly troubling.

      Science highlighted problems such as inadequate in-hospital ventilation, extensive transmission caused by unmanaged super spreaders, poor infection control measures, and refusal to disclose the names of hospitals where confirmed cases of MERS had been treated or sought treatment.

      The Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that problems with the initial response in South Korea could be attributed to inconsistent definition and isolation of close contacts, subsequent failure to conduct pre-emptive quarantines, and the Government's failure to implement appropriate crisis communication measures.

       The official daily briefing reports included patient serial number, day of diagnosis, infection route, sex, age and hospital. The sex and age of all 186 South Korean cases were determined. Outbreaks were defined as occurring in hospital, within the family or in the community. Sources of exposure were divided into three groups: healthcare professionals [doctors, nurses, medical technicians (e.g. radiologists) and medical transport staff]; infections contracted in hospitals by inpatients or outpatients; and infections acquired through visiting hospitalized patients or familial care-giving.

       ). The 186 cases comprised the index case, his wife (infected in the household setting) and 184 nosocomially acquired cases. The most common route of exposure was through hospital visits (including family members who acted as care-givers), which accounted for 103 (55.7%) cases. Fifty-four (29.2%) cases occurred in patients who were hospitalized for other reasons, and 25 (13.5%) cases were occupationally acquired by healthcare workers (

      South Korea has the world's second highest number of confirmed MERS cases after Saudi Arabia. While South Korea has officially reported 186 confirmed cases of MERS, WHO reports 185 confirmed cases.

      This discrepancy is due to the fact that the South Korean Government included a South Korean patient who was diagnosed with MERS in China during a business trip, despite the fact that he was a suspected case while in South Korea. As in Saudi Arabia, MERS was more common in males than in females in South Korea.

      The fatality rate for MERS in South Korea was 19.9%. In contrast, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the global MERS fatality rate between March 2012 and October 2015 was 38.6% (1616 confirmed cases and 624 deaths). There were marked regional differences in mortality rates: 41.1% in the Middle East, 53.3% in Europe and 40.0% in Africa, compared with 19.2% in Asian countries.

      One of the reasons why South Korea has a lower fatality rate than other MERS-outbreak countries may be accessibility to a high level of emergency medical treatment. The difference does not appear to be attributable to mutations in the virus.

      There was also a difference in the types of underlying conditions associated with fatal MERS in South Korea compared with Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, diabetes mellitus (74% of patients) was the most common underlying condition in fatal cases, followed by end-stage renal disease (52%), lung disease (43%) and cardiac disease (39%).

      However, it was noted that MERS testing was only available to patients known to have been in close contact with a confirmed or suspected case; as such, more casual contacts of MERS cases may have been missed because they were not tested. However, global experience does indicate that MERS is predominantly a nosocomially acquired infection,

      Immediately after the MERS outbreak in South Korea, many researchers reported various problems with the South Korean Government's MERS control measures. It was reported that South Korea's MERS outbreak was caused by poor hospital infection control standards and lack of monitoring close contacts, which was also the case in Saudi Arabia.

       <sup>

      It was highlighted that public risk communication was delayed because the South Korean Government prioritized the determination of all details of the outbreak rather than information disclosure. This resulted in widespread panic during the MERS crisis.

      Jack pointed out that while the biological basis for the initial failure to contain MERS is unclear, a number of factors contributed significantly, including ‘doctor shopping’ behaviour (i.e. a patient seeks treatment from various hospitals for the same ailment), lack of epidemiology experts, the culture of frequent hospital visits and familial care-giving, and the South Korean Government's steadfast stance on keeping information contained.

      WHO experts indicated that problems with the initial spread of MERS in South Korea included prevalent occurrences among medical staff, lack of hospital infection management procedures, extremely crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed rooms in some hospitals, ‘doctor shopping’ behaviour, and the spread of infection through patient's family members or friends during hospital visits.

      Finally, Choi

      reported that South Korea's initial failure to control MERS was caused by South Korea's rigid application of MERS control guidelines which failed to isolate all close contacts, failure to recognize super-spreading events, environmental factors such as inadequate ventilation, insufficient infectious disease management capacity in secondary hospitals, and the South Korean Government's inadequate crisis management communication.

      Many healthcare professionals in South Korea reported that the spread of MERS in South Korea could be characterized by the fact that hospitals acted as the main infection location, and by super-spreading events, where one case infects a number of others.

      The occurrence of super-spreading events is known to be determined by physiological factors of the host, transmissibility of the pathogen, and the environment (e.g. crowding).

      Lim pointed out that as the MERS-CoV isolated in South Korea did not differ from that isolated in other countries, there is a lack of biological evidence to support the occurrence of super-spreading events.

       <sup>

      </xref>
      As such, super-spreading events must have been caused by environmental factors, including the South Korean Government's inadequate crisis response management. Other countries should be aware of this in their response to imported MERS cases. The debate on MERS infection handling in South Korea continues, with many local experts proposing improvement measures locally to prevent future national outbreaks of infectious diseases.

      This narrative account of the South Korean experience of MERS describes some issues that are of local importance alone, but also contains some important lessons of wider relevance. First, the importance of early detection of cases; second, the role of super spreaders of the virus; and third, the importance of restricting hospital visitors as a control measure. It is also suggested that hospitals need to be prepared for eventualities such as MERS, such as by ensuring that they have the necessary facilities and equipment for patient isolation. For countries such as South Korea where medical care is insurance based, insurance coverage for infectious diseases should be included in insurance plans to ensure that there are no delays in clinical care.

        The emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has awakened the echoes of SARS-CoV from nearly two decades ago. Yet, with technological advances and important lessons gained from previous outbreaks, perhaps the world is better equipped to deal with the most recent emergent group 2B coronavirus.

     </title>
     <p>
      The third zoonotic human coronavirus (CoV) of the century emerged in December 2019, with a cluster of patients with connections to Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, patients exhibited symptoms of viral pneumonia including fever, difficulty breathing, and bilateral lung infiltration in the most severe cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-viruses-12-00135">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. News reports of patients with an unknown pneumonia were first identified on 31st December with the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission saying they were monitoring the situation closely (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00135-f001">
       Figure 1
      </xref>
      ). On 1st January 2020, the seafood market was closed and decontaminated while countries with travel links to Wuhan went on high alert for potential travelers with unexplained respiratory disease. After extensive speculation about a causative agent, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a report by the Wall Street Journal and announced identification of a novel CoV on 9th January [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-12-00135">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. The novel CoV (2019-nCoV) was isolated from a single patient and subsequently verified in 16 additional patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-viruses-12-00135">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. While not yet confirmed to induce the viral pneumonia, 2019-nCoV was quickly predicted as the likely causative agent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first sequence of 2019-nCoV was posted online one day after its confirmation on behalf of Dr. Yong-Zhen Zhang and scientists at Fudan University, Shanghai [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-viruses-12-00135">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. Subsequently, five additional 2019-nCoV sequences were deposited on the GSAID database on 11th January from institutes across China (Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College) and allowed researchers around the world to begin analyzing the new CoV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-viruses-12-00135">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. By 17th January, there were 62 confirmed cases in China and importantly, three exported cases of infected travelers who were diagnosed in Thailand (2) and Japan (1) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-viruses-12-00135">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. The sequences of these exported cases and several additional 2019-nCoV isolated in China have also been deposited on the GSAID database [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-viruses-12-00135">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Diagnostic tests have subsequently been developed and some are being used on suspect cases identified in other locations including Vietnam, Singapore, and Hong Kong [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-viruses-12-00135">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. To date there have been twenty-six fatalities associated with 2019-nCoV infection, many of these cases had significant co-morbidities and were older in age (&gt;50). A range of disease has been observed highlighted by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and leukopenia; patients have included mild cases needing supportive care to severe cases requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; however, compared to SARS-CoV (10% mortality) and MERS-CoV (35% mortality), the 2019-nCoV appears to be less virulent at this point with the exception of the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Initial monitoring of case close contacts had not revealed any further 2019-nCoV cases. However, modeling analysis based on official case numbers and international spread suggested that there may be cases going undetected [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-viruses-12-00135">
       8
      </xref>
      ]. On 19th January, these fears were seemingly confirmed as an additional 136 cases were added from further surveys raising the total in Wuhan to 198 infected patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-12-00135">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. Among the 198 total cases in Wuhan, 170 remained in hospitals, 126 mostly with mild symptoms, 35 in serious condition, and 9 in critical condition. The expanded numbers and extended range of onset dates (12 December 2019–18 January 2020) suggested likely human to human transmission or ongoing transmission from a market or other primary sources. On 20th January, the outbreak was further expanded to other parts of China (Beijing, Shanghai, &amp; Shenzhen) as well as another exported cases to South Korea. As of January 24, the total case number has expanded to at least 870 total cases with 26 deaths across 25 provinces in China and 19 exported cases in 10 countries [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-12-00135">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. Public health authorities have quarantined travel from Wuhan to limit the spread of the virus and reports indicate other Chinese cities have also been isolated [

      2. Origins of 2019-nCoV
     </title>
     <p>
      The source of the 2019-nCoV is still unknown, although the initial cases have been associated with the Huanan South China Seafood Market. While many of the early patients worked in or visited the market, none of the exported cases had contact with the market, suggesting either human to human transmission or a more widespread animal source [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-viruses-12-00135">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. In addition to seafood, it is reported on social media that snakes, birds and other small mammals including marmots and bats were sold at the Huanan South China Seafood Market. The WHO reported that environmental samples taken from the marketplace have come back positive for the novel coronavirus, but no specific animal association has been identified [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-viruses-12-00135">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. An initial report suggested that snakes might be the possible source based on codon usage [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-viruses-12-00135">
       12
      </xref>
      ], but the assertion has been disputed by others [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-viruses-12-00135">
       13
      </xref>
      ]. Researchers are currently working to identify the source of 2019-nCoV including possible intermediate animal vectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      A zoonotic reservoir harkens back to the emergence of both SARS- and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV, the first highly pathogenic human CoV, emerged in 2002 with transmission from animals to humans occurring in wet markets. Surveillance efforts found SARS-CoV viral RNA in both palm civets and raccoon dogs sold in these wet markets [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-viruses-12-00135">
       14
      </xref>
      ]; however, SARS-CoV was not found in the wild, suggesting that those species served as intermediary reservoir as the virus adapted to more efficiently infect humans. Further surveillance efforts identified highly related CoVs in bat species [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-viruses-12-00135">
       15
      </xref>
      ]. More recent work has demonstrated that several bat CoVs are capable of infecting human cells without a need for intermediate adaptation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-12-00135">
       16
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-viruses-12-00135">
       17
      </xref>
      ]. Additionally, human serology data shows recognition of bat CoV proteins and indicates that low-level zoonotic transmission of SARS-like bat coronaviruses occurs outside of recognized outbreaks [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-viruses-12-00135">
       18
      </xref>
      ]. MERS-CoV is also a zoonotic virus with possible origins in bats [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-viruses-12-00135">
       19
      </xref>

      ], although camels are endemically infected and camel contact is frequently reported during primary MERS-CoV cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-viruses-12-00135">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. For SARS-CoV, strict quarantine and the culling of live markets in SE Asia played a major role in ending the outbreak. With the cultural importance of camels, a similar approach for MERS-CoV was not an option and periodic outbreaks continue in the Middle East. These lessons from SARS and MERS highlight the importance of rapidly finding the source for 2019-nCoV in order to stem the ongoing outbreak.

      3. Susceptible Populations
     </title>
     <p>
      With limited patient data, it is difficult to make robust declarations about populations that may be most susceptible to 2019-nCoV. However, disease severity following SARS- and MERS-CoV corresponded strongly to underlying host conditions including age, biological sex, and overall health [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-viruses-12-00135">
       22
      </xref>
      ]. Early patient reports from 2019-nCoV find similar trends. Severe illness with 2019-nCoV has been associated with elderly patients (&gt;60 years old), including twenty-six lethal cases. These findings correspond to increased severity and death in people over the age of 50 following both SARS and MERS-CoV infection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-viruses-12-00135">
       23

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-viruses-12-00135">
       24
      </xref>
      ]. Similarly, the underlying health of the patient likely plays a critical role in overall susceptibility. For the 2019-nCoV, limited comorbidity data is available; however, the twenty-six patients that have succumbed to the novel CoV had significant health conditions including hypertension, diabetes, heart and/or kidney function issues that may have made them more susceptible. For the MERS-CoV outbreak, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and/or other chronic illnesses have been present in the majority of deaths and correspond to findings in animal models [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-viruses-12-00135">
       25
      </xref>
      ]. The results indicate vigilance is necessary for these vulnerable patients following 2019-nCoV infection.

      4. Insights from the 2019-nCoV Sequence
     </title>
     <p>
      The rapid sequencing of the nearly 30,000 nucleotide 2019-nCoV genome by Dr. Zhang’s group at Fudan University and several other groups in China illustrate the dedication and increased capacity of the scientific infrastructure in China [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-viruses-12-00135">
       4
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-viruses-12-00135">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. For SARS-CoV, the causative agent was unknown for months and subsequently took over four weeks until a full genome was released [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-viruses-12-00135">
       26
      </xref>
      ]. Similarly, MERS-CoV was only identified after several months of testing and a full-length genome available about a month later [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-viruses-12-00135">
       27
      </xref>
      ]. In contrast, time from the first date of patient onset (12 December 2019) to the report of several 2019-nCoV full-length genomes took less than one month. Combined with the immense pressure of an ongoing outbreak with an unknown agent, the effort of these scientists should be considered nothing less than remarkable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Building from the sequence, the nucleotide alignment quickly distinguished the novel virus as a group 2B CoV, distinct from the SARS-CoV strains [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-viruses-12-00135">
       4
      </xref>

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-viruses-12-00135">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Examining the whole genome, 2019-nCoV maintains ~80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS epidemic viruses. Its closest whole genome relatives are two bat SARS-like CoVs (ZC45 and ZXC21) that shared ~89% sequence identity with 2019-nCoV; these CoV sequences were deposited in early 2018 from Zhejiang province in
      <italic>
       R. sinicus
      </italic>
      bats in China. Comparing across the deposited 2019-nCoV strains finds &gt; 99.5% conservation; the lack of diversity suggests a common lineage and source with emergence not likely having occurred that long ago [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-viruses-12-00135">
       28
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-12-00135">
       29
      </xref>
      ]. A recent report has subsequently identified a bat CoV sequence, RaTG3, with 92% sequence identity with the novel virus which argues for bat origins for the 2019-nCoV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-12-00135">
       30
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      We next shifted analysis to the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the most abundant protein produced in CoVs. Generally, the N protein is well conserved across CoV families including group 2B [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-viruses-12-00135">
       31
      </xref>
      ]. The N protein for 2019-nCoV is no exception with ~90% amino acid identity to the SARS-CoV N protein. While less conserved than other group 2B CoVs like HKU3-CoV and SHC014-CoV, 2019-nCoV antibodies against the N protein would likely recognize and bind the SARS-CoV N protein as well. N antibodies do not provide immunity to 2019-nCoV infection, but the cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein would allow a serum based assay to determine exposure to the novel CoV in asymptomatic cases. While previous studies have found serum reactivity to group 2B virus N proteins in Chinese populations [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-viruses-12-00135">
       18
      </xref>
      ], exposure to 2019-nCoV should increase the dilution factor substantially if exposure/infection had occurred. Importantly, this information may provide insights about susceptibly and potential routes of spread through asymptomatic carriers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Examining further, we next compared the spike proteins, the critical glycoprotein responsible for virus binding and entry. Overall, the 2019-nCoV spike protein has roughly 75% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV, which is less conserved than other group 2B CoVs including HKU3-CoV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-viruses-12-00135">
       31
      </xref>
      ]. However, narrowing analysis to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (amino acids 318–518), the 2019-nCoV RBD is 73% conserved relative to the epidemic RBD. This conservation level places the 2019-nCoV RBD between HKU3-4 (62.7% conservation), a bat virus that cannot use human ACE2, and rSHC014 (80.8%), the most divergent bat CoV spike known to use human ACE2 for entry [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-12-00135">
       16
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-viruses-12-00135">
       32
      </xref>
      ]. Importantly, the key binding residues for SARS-CoV have been identified [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-viruses-12-00135">
       33
      </xref>
      ]; among these fourteen residues predicted to interact directly with human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, eight amino acids are conserved in 2019-nCoV. Notably, several of these residues are also conserved relative to WIV1- and WIV16-CoV, two bat strains closely related to SARS-CoV and known to use human ACE2 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-viruses-12-00135">
       17
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-viruses-12-00135">
       34
      </xref>
      ]. Initial structural modeling suggest that the 2019-nCoV may be able to use human ACE2 as a receptor, although its affinity m be reduced relative to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-viruses-12-00135">
       35
      </xref>
      ]. A subsequent report demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV was capable of binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-viruses-12-00135">
       36
      </xref>
      ]. In addition, another rapid report links demonstrates 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 receptors from human, bat, civets, and swine [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-12-00135">
       30
      </xref>
      ]. Together, the modeling, pseudotyping, and infection data provide strong evidence for human ACE2 being the receptor for 2019-nCoV.

      5. Achieving Koch Postulates
     </title>
     <p>
      Traditional identification of a microbe as the causative agent of disease requires fulfillment of Koch’s postulates, modified by Rivers for viral diseases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-viruses-12-00135">
       37
      </xref>
      ]. At the present time, the 2019-nCoV has been isolated from patients, detected by specific assays in patients, and cultured in host cells (one available sequence is identified as a passage isolate), starting to fulfill these criteria. Given the recentness of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, at this point there is no animal model available to fulfill the remaining criteria: 1) testing the capability of 2019-nCoV to cause respiratory disease in a related species, 2) re-isolating the virus from the experimentally infected animal and 3) detection of a specific immune response. These efforts will surely be an area of intense research in the coming months both in China and in CoV research laboratories around the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notably, generating small animal models of coronavirus disease can be difficult. While SARS-CoV readily infected laboratory mice, it does not cause significant disease unless the virus is passaged to adapt to the mouse host [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-viruses-12-00135">
       38
      </xref>
      ]. Infection of primates produces a more mild disease than that observed in humans, although fever and pulmonary inflammation were noted [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-viruses-12-00135">
       39

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-viruses-12-00135">
       40
      </xref>
      ]. MERS-CoV is incapable of infecting rodent cells without engineering changes in critical residues of the receptor protein, DPP4 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-viruses-12-00135">
       41

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-viruses-12-00135">
       42
      </xref>
      ]. However, MERS-CoV does infect non-human primates [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43-viruses-12-00135">
       43
      </xref>
      ]. As such, MERS mouse models of disease required a great deal of time to develop and are limited in the types of manipulations that can be performed [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-viruses-12-00135">
       41
      </xref>
      ]. At this point, the infectious capability of the 2019-nCoV for different species and different cell types is unknown. Early reports suggest that the virus can utilize human, bat, swine, and civet ACE2 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-12-00135">
       30
      </xref>
      ]; notably, the group found mouse Ace2 was not permissive for 2019-nCoV infection Dissemination of virus stocks and/or de novo generation of the virus through reverse genetics systems will enable this research allowing for animal testing and subsequent completion of Koch’s postulates for the new virus.

      6. Threat for Spread: Human to Human, Health Care Workers, and Super Spreaders
     </title>
     <p>
      While the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan has been associated with the majority of cases, many of the recent cases do not have a direct connection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-12-00135">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. This fact suggests a secondary source of infection, either human to human transmission or possibly infected animals in another market in Wuhan. Both possibilities represent major concerns and indicate the outbreak has the potential to expand rapidly. For human to human transmission, there was limited data in the initial set of cases; one family cluster is of three men who all work in the market. Similarly, a husband and wife are among the patients, with the wife claiming no contact with the market. In these cases, direct human to human infection may have been possible; alternatively, a contaminated fomite from the market may also be responsible as surfaces all around the market were found to test positive 2019-nCoV. However, the major increase in the number of cases, the lack of direct connection to the Wuhan market for many cases, and the infection of health care works all suggest human to human spread is likely [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-12-00135">
       9
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-viruses-12-00135">
       44
      </xref>
      ]. Importantly, until the source of the virus is found, it will be difficult to distinguish zoonotic versus human to human spread.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the early part of the outbreak, the absence of infection in health care workers argued for inefficient human to human spread and distinguished 2019-nCoV from both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In the two prior CoV epidemics, health care settings served as a major transmission point fueling both outbreaks. Based on WHO data, 1 in 10 MERS-CoV cases have been found to be health care workers; these patients generally have reduced disease and death likely due to younger age and absence of existing health conditions. The recent reports of numerous infected health care workers in Wuhan indicate human to human infection can occur with 2019-nCoV and may be the product of a super spreading patient [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-viruses-12-00135">
       44
      </xref>
      ]. However, while large swaths of healthcare workers are not getting sick as seen with SARS and MERS-CoV, it may be too early to rule out their potential exposure to the novel CoV as their disease may be asymptomatic. While not described during the SARS-CoV outbreak, asymptomatic cases ranged from 12.5% to 25% in some MERS-CoV studies [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-viruses-12-00135">
       45
      </xref>
      ]. A similar phenomenon may be occurring with 2019-nCoV and would make stopping the outbreak even more difficult to contain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another parameter to consider is the possibility of super spreading in the context of 2019-nCoV. Super spreading is the amplified transmission of a virus by individuals in a population and has been suggested by at least one news report [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-viruses-12-00135">
       44
      </xref>
      ]. Both SARS- and MERS-CoV outbreaks had documented evidence of super spreading patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-viruses-12-00135">
       46
      </xref>
      ]. In general, both epidemic CoVs maintain a low R
      <sub>
       0
      </sub>
      , the rate spread from an individual infected patient. However, roughly 10% of SARS- and MERS-CoV patients have been associated with super spreading and an R
      <sub>
       0
      </sub>
      &gt; 10. These cases seeded a significant portion of the epidemic around the world. Notably, neither mutations in the viruses nor severity of disease were found to be associated with super spreading, implying that host factors contribute to the phenotype [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-viruses-12-00135">
       47
      </xref>
      ]. For 2019-nCoV, contact tracing to date suggest limited human to human spread and a low R
      <sub>
       0
      </sub>
      . However, the recent increase in cases, both in and outside Wuhan could signal the existence of super-spreading individuals fueling the outbreak. Alternatively, super spreading could occur from the zoonotic source which has been seen in other disease outbreaks [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-12-00135">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. In any event, the possibility of super spreading may continue to play a role in this ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak.

      7. Emerging Diseases in the Age of Social Media
     </title>
     <p>
      News of the 2019-nCoV came to widespread attention through the internet. Over the years, websites like FluTrackers.com, ProMED (promedmail.org), and others have permitted the collection of disease information from around the world and facilitated dissemination to interested parties. In 2012, MERS-CoV first drew attention as a “novel coronavirus” entioned on ProMED Mail and subsequently through conversation on twitter between science journalists, virologists, and public health experts. Eight years later, a more connected network quickly dissected statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission and speculated about possible causes. Early during an outbreak, it can be difficult to distinguish between rumors with elements of truth versus baseless fear mongering. This fact can be exacerbated by language barriers and off the record sources. However, in this case, speculation of a novel coronavirus was fed by carefully worded statements that specifically excluding some virus families (influenza, adenovirus), but only excluded SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV for coronaviruses. Coupled with memories of the SARS outbreak, many worried that the truth may be held back. When the agent was finally confirmed as a CoV, the world acted with both worry and relief: the outbreak would not be hidden.
     </p>
     <p>
      While far from perfect, the government response to 2019-nCoV provides a stark contrast to the SARS outbreak at the beginning of the century. The rapid release of 2019-nCoV sequences permitted the research community to quickly become engaged, providing analysis and developing diagnostic tests. Both the Chinese CDC and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission have posted regular updates of confirmed case numbers and patient statuses enabling public health authorities to monitor the situation in real time. Researchers from around the world have connected on social media to compare updated sequence information and highlight key unknowns about the outbreak. While not always provided in a timely manner, the ability to share news updates and data in real time with researchers and public health officials around the world signals a major change in the response to outbreaks. This connectivity has facilitated awareness as well as new collaborations and a rapid response by the global research community. While there are many unknowns with 2019-nCoV, the world is engaged and prepared to battle the newest emergent virus strain. Perhaps this means the lessons from the SARS outbreak have truly been learned.

           Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe respiratory disease in humans. Although disease progression is fairly similar for SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate of MERS is much higher than that of SARS.

           Comorbidities have an important role in SARS and MERS. Several risk factors are associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS and MERS cases, especially advanced age and male sex. For MERS, additional risk factors that are associated with severe disease include chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, renal and lung disease, and co-infections.

           Although the ancestors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV probably circulate in bats, zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV required an incidental amplifying host. Dromedary camels are the MERS-CoV reservoir from which zoonotic transmission occurs; serological evidence indicates that MERS-CoV-like viruses have been circulating in dromedary camels for at least three decades.

           Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurs mainly in health care settings. Patients do not shed large amounts of virus until well after the onset of symptoms, when patients are most probably already seeking medical care. Analysis of hospital surfaces after the treatment of patients with MERS showed the ubiquitous presence of infectious virus.

        The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 marked the second introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. The continuing introductions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels, the subsequent travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates highlight the need for prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Scientific advancements since the 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic allowed for rapid progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the development of therapeutics. In this Review, we detail our present understanding of the transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and discuss the current state of development of measures to combat emerging coronaviruses.

      This Review highlights the pandemic and epidemic potential of emerging coronaviruses and discusses our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including their transmission, their pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures. Key features of these viruses are the dominance of nosocomial transmission, and pathogenesis that is driven by a combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant host immune response. Several potential treatments for SARS and MERS have been identified in animal and

         | The single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) encode two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), including papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (Hel) and exonuclease (ExoN). An additional 9–12 ORFs are encoded through the transcription of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV form spherical particles that consist of four structural proteins. The envelope glycoprotein spike (S) forms a layer of glycoproteins that protrude from the envelope. Two additional transmembrane glycoproteins are incorporated in the virion: envelope (E) and membrane (M). Inside the viral envelope resides the helical nucleocapsid, which consists of the viral positive-sense RNA ((+)RNA) genome encapsidated by protein nucleocapsid (N).

         | Following entry of the virus into the host cell, the viral RNA is uncoated in the cytoplasm. ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated to produce pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved by the proteases that are encoded by ORF1a to yield 16 nsps that form the RNA replicase–transcriptase complex. This complex localizes to modified intracellular membranes that are derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the perinuclear region, and it drives the production of negative-sense RNAs ((−)RNAs) through both replication and transcription. During replication, full-length (−)RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as templates for full-length (+)RNA genomes. During transcription, a subset of 7–9 subgenomic RNAs, including those encoding all structural proteins, is produced through discontinuous transcription. In this process, subgenomic (−)RNAs are synthesized by combining varying lengths of the 3′ end of the genome with the 5′ leader sequence necessary for translation. These subgenomic (−)RNAs are then transcribed into subgenomic (+)mRNAs. Although the different subgenomic mRNAs may contain several ORFs, only the first ORF (that closest to the 5′ end) is translated. The resulting structural proteins are assembled into the nucleocapsid and viral envelope at the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), followed by release of the nascent virion from the infected cell.

         Bats harbour a wide range of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-like and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-like viruses. SARS-CoV crossed the species barrier into masked palm civets and other animals in live-animal markets in China; genetic analysis suggests that this occurred in late 2002. Several people in close proximity to palm civets became infected with SARS-CoV. A MERS-CoV ancestral virus crossed the species barrier into dromedary camels; serological evidence suggests that this happened more than 30 years ago. Abundant circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels results in frequent zoonotic transmission of this virus. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spread between humans mainly through nosocomial transmission, which results in the infection of health care workers and patients at a higher frequency than infection of their relatives.

      Thus, the search for the reservoir of MERS-CoV initially focused on bats, but a serological survey in dromedary camels from Oman and the Canary Islands showed a high prevalence of MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies in these animals

      . Serological evidence for the circulation of a MERS-CoV-like virus in dromedary camels has been obtained in the Middle East, Eastern Africa and Northern Africa, dating back as far as 1983 (Ref.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">

      , including those that have caused human outbreaks. Taken together, these data strongly point to the role of dromedary camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. The ubiquity of infected dromedary camels close to humans and the resulting continuing zoonotic transmission may explain why MERS-CoV continues to cause infections in humans, whereas SARS-CoV, without the continuing presence of an infected intermediate host and with relatively infrequent human–bat interactions, has caused no more infections in humans.

      Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurs mainly through nosocomial transmission; 43.5–100% of MERS cases in individual outbreaks were linked to hospitals, and very similar observations were made for some of the SARS clusters

The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE, and it has been suggested that the stimulation of type 1a angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) increases pulmonary vascular permeability, thus potentially explaining the increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased

Retrospective longitudinal studies in patients who recovered from SARS versus those who succumbed to the disease have shown an early expression of interferon-α (IFNα), IFNγ, CXCL10, CCL2 and proteins that are encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in all patients, but only patients who survived then had gene expression profiles that are indicative of the development of an adaptive immune response. By contrast, patients who succumbed maintained high levels of CXCL10, CCL2 and ISG-encoded proteins, whereas spike-specific antibodies were present at low levels or were absent

      SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use several strategies to avoid the innate immune response. Viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or uncapped mRNA, are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I; also known as DDX58) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5; also known as IFIH1)

         | The innate immune response is activated by the detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or uncapped mRNA. This occurs via host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), potentially via dsRNA-binding partners such as IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase activator A (PRKRA). Following PRR-mediated detection of a PAMP, the resulting interaction of PRRs with mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through a signalling cascade involving several kinases. Activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The kinases also phosphorylate (P) IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, which form homodimers and heterodimers and enter the nucleus to initiate the transcription of type I interferons (type I IFNs). Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have developed mechanisms to interfere with these signalling pathways, as shown; these subversion strategies involve both structural proteins (membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)) and non-structural proteins (nsp1, nsp3b, nsp4a, nsp4b, nsp5, nsp6 and papain-like protease (PLpro); indicated in the figure by just their nsp numbers and letters).

         | Binding of type I IFNs to their dimeric receptor, IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR), activates the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway, in which JAK1 and TYK2 kinases phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which form complexes with IRF9. These complexes move into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) under the control of promoters that contain an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). Collectively, the expression of cytokines, IFNs and ISGs establishes an antiviral innate immune response that limits viral replication in infected and in neighbouring cells. Again, viral proteins have been shown to inhibit these host signalling pathways to evade this immune response. IκBα, NF-κB inhibitor-α.

Furthermore, generation of monoclonal antibodies for use in humans is well established, with a fairly straightforward path to safety and efficacy testing. However, to date, there are very few reports on the use of convalescent plasma and none on the use of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for acute, severe respiratory disease in humans. A post hoc meta-analysis of 32 studies of either SARS or severe influenza found a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality when convalescent plasma was used

Moreover, it is unclear who to vaccinate against MERS-CoV, as healthy individuals seem to be at little risk of severe disease. Older patients or patients with underlying disease, who have the highest risk of severe MERS, would be important target populations. However, vaccination in such patients can be problematic owing to their poor immune responses, as has been established for influenza virus

The rational design of new drugs and the repurposing of existing compounds have already resulted in the development of PLpro inhibitors and the identification of kinase inhibitors that inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

      <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec8">

      ). Owing to the acute nature of MERS and the important role of immunopathology, combination therapies aimed at simultaneously inhibiting viral replication, limiting viral dissemination and dampening the host response are likely to yield the best results. Furthermore, treatment should be started as early as possible, rather than waiting until the patient has already developed extensive lung damage.

     <p id="Par58">
      The development of therapies against SARS and MERS needs to focus on testing in humans, in properly controlled clinical trials. The current non-standardized, uncontrolled approach to treatment is not informative and may not be beneficial to the patient. The recent Ebola outbreak has demonstrated that rapid clinical trial design and approval are possible and that exceptional situations call for deviations from normal procedures (

      While treatments are being developed and evaluated, the prevention of viral transmission is key to reducing the burden of MERS. The large proportion of nosocomial MERS-CoV infections indicates that preventive measures in hospitals are currently either not fully implemented or insufficient. Prevention of zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels is another possibility to decrease the number of MERS cases. The first vaccines against MERS-CoV have been tested in dromedary camels

        Most of our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) comes from animal studies. Ideally, these models recapitulate all or specific aspects of human disease. Several mouse models have been established, for example by using mouse-adapted SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or expressing human receptors in mice

Although it has been recognized that mice might poorly mimic specific human responses to infection, the availability of knockout and transgenic mice enables the targeted study of virus–host interactions. Several non-human primate models have been developed for SARS-CoV and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)

        When the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak developed into the first pandemic of the twenty-first century, it became clear that the medical and scientific communities were not adequately prepared for the emergence of highly pathogenic viruses.

Unfortunately, the SARS pandemic did not yield solid clinical data on the efficacy of treatment regimens. These data are urgently needed for the treatment of MERS, as well as to prepare for novel coronaviruses that may emerge.

        The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the need for fast-tracking of potential treatments, as several clinical trials were started only towards the end of the outbreak. The combined experiences of the outbreaks of SARS, MERS and Ebola provide a blueprint for the response to emerging pathogens: after the identification of the causative agent, diagnostic assays need to be developed and distributed rapidly, and simultaneously, awareness of the new syndrome and reporting of (suspected) cases must be increased. In addition, infection control measures in health care facilities are essential. Research needs to focus on understanding the epidemiology, including pathogen transmission and identification of the reservoir and/or intermediate hosts. Animal models need to be developed, as well as therapeutic and prophylactic measures. Finally, promising treatments need to be fast-tracked into clinical trials.

        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory illness with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 35,5%. The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012–2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015–2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (

Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible. These results indicate public health agencies should be aware that measures for strict containment are urgently needed before new epidemics take off in the region.

       <p>
        There is currently no way to anticipate MERS-CoV epidemic outbreaks and strategies for disease prediction and containment are largely undermined by the limited knowledge of its epidemiological cycle. Not an effective treatment nor a vaccine for MERS-CoV exist to date. Instead, using three two-strain mathematical models that incorporate human social behavior as different disease incidence functions (e.g. bilinear, non-monotone and saturated), the best model combinations successfully anticipate the occurrence of the peak week in the season and the incidence at the peak. Our results confirm there are currently 2 strains co-circulating in the most populated regions in Saudi Arabia and highlight the high risk for large epidemic outbreaks, while the role of super-spreaders appears irrelevant for disease spread.

      Introduction
     </title>
     <p>
      The first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012[

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref005">

      </xref>
      ]. Since then the country suffers from repeated outbreaks of MERS-CoV in different provinces (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">
       Fig 1A and 1B

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref002">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. There are two main routes of MERS-CoV transmission: animal-to-human and human-to-human[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref004">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref006">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. It is suspected that dromedary camels are the source of human infections[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref001">
       1
      </xref>
      ] but the transmission route of MERS-CoV to humans is yet not well understood (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">
       Fig 1C
      </xref>
      ). However, transmission from camels to humans is confirmed from the isolation of near-identical strains of MERS-CoV from epidemiologically coexisting camels and humans[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref007">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. The patients might be exposed to MERS-CoV by consumption of raw camel products[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref008">
       8
      </xref>
      ] (e.g. milk and dairy products, raw meat, etc.). Meanwhile, human-to-human transmission has been reported in society and hospital settings[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref009">
       9
      </xref>

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref036">
       36
      </xref>
      ] with the virus being transmitted between humans during close human-to-human contact through droplets of respiratory secretions. Potential propagation to nearby and more distant regions is also a high-risk possibility as an outbreak of MERS-CoV is likely to emerge in areas such as nearby countries in the Middle East and eastern Africa where the camel trade connects the different regions (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g001">
       Fig 1
      </xref>
      ). Unfortunately, as for now, MERS-CoV vaccines are only at the preclinical phase[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref010">
       10
      </xref>
      ], increasing our understanding of its epidemic potential and knowledge on the drivers of MERS-CoV variability might help to achieve better preparedness ahead of forthcoming epidemics.

      The ability to predict disease outbreaks will provide a mechanism for policymakers and health-care services to respond to epidemics in a timely manner, reducing the impact and maximizing the limited resources available to be deployed[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref011">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. The timing and severity of infectious disease outbreaks, two matters of considerable public-health relevance, are the main challenges when attempting to predict disease outbreaks[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref011">

      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref014">
       14
      </xref>
      ]. Attempts to set up prediction frameworks for anticipating epidemics for other diseases such as dengue and influenza were pursued in the recent past with different degree of success, but clear added value[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref011">

      </xref>
      ]. These systems proved effective to better anticipate future outbreaks and increase our understanding on mechanisms driving disease variability. To this end, a threshold quantity that is most important to anticipate the risk of future outbreaks is the basic reproduction number (

      ]. However, at the same time, intriguing differences in observed and predicted scenarios clearly suggested other important factors might be missing in previous models built for these MERS-CoV case studies. For instance, in a recent survey for Mers-CoV in over 1300 Saudi Arabian camels, Sabiret al.[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref001">
       1
      </xref>
      ] found that camels share three coronaviruses (CoV) species with humans. Among them, one has been dominant in the region since December 2014 and led to the human MERS-CoV outbreaks occurring in 2015. The wide species range of CoVs and their propensity to cross species boundaries suggest that more MERS-CoV uncontained outbreaks may likely occur in the future. Zumlaet al.[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref019">
       19
      </xref>
      ] also suggested that MERS-CoV species can mutate to have increased inter-human transmissibility. Cottenet al.[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref037">
       37
      </xref>
      ] used MERS data from the period May to September 2013. They found four Saudi Arabia MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases, therefore not appearing in the saliva of camels. They also show that the ancestors of most of the viral clades originated in Riyadh (See Cotten et al.[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref037">
       37
      </xref>
      ]). Recently, strain variability in MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 51 respiratory samples from 32 patients, confirming that more than one strain of human MERS-CoVis present[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref020">
       20
      </xref>
      ]. The fact that more than one MERS-CoV strain is currently circulating in Saudi Arabia should be properly accounted for as this presence may have substantially contributed to amplify the transmission intensity producing repeated MERS-CoV changes in incidence through their periodic reintroduction into human populations[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref019">
       19
      </xref>
      ]. Furthermore, Chan et al.[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref034">
       34
      </xref>
      ] characterized MERS-CoV viruses from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and compared them with a human MERS-CoV reference strain. They isolated three dromedary strains, two from Saudi Arabia and one from Egypt. The human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains had similar viral replication competence in Vero-E6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract. They also suggested that dromedary viruses from Saudi Arabia and Egypt are probably infectious to human beings[

       represents the BL force of infection. Here, as the number of infected individuals increases the disease transmission also increases linearly. The bottom-left panel represents the NM incidence function. Biologically this incidence function can account for “psychological effects” [

       ]. In the presence of psychological effects, initially the disease transmission rate increases rapidly when the number of infected individuals is small. However, this rate falls also rapidly in the presence of a large number of infected persons in the community. As in the case of MERS-CoV infections the CFR is about 40%, psychological effects for this infection represents the effect in the community of fear of becoming infected. This fear effect reduces the transmission rate rapidly in the presence of a high number of infections in the community. The bottom-right panel of

        Fig 2

       represents the SAT incidence function. Biologically this incidence function represents the crowding effect in disease transmission. This crowding effect explains how the number of new infections becomes constant as the number of infected individual increases. This effect is known to reproduce the awareness effect of the disease during the course of an epidemic.

       ]. We also estimated from data itself some unknown initial conditions for the model. Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm is used here to sample the 95% confidence.The goodness of fitsto compare among 2-strain and single strain models were tested by determining the respective AIC and BIC values (See

       ). To further compare among predictive capabilities of these models with regard to those of their single-strain versions, predictions of raw clinical cases were attempted. Albeit some discrepancies exist, fairly accurate results were obtained despite the low numbers and highly stochastic nature of the three datasets and the nearly operational capacity of these models (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g003">
        Fig 3

       ). In fact, near-operational systems usually require a much longer training period than the scarce three years employed here. Differences arising from the comparison of simulated and observed cases may also be due to the fact that we are fitting the 2-strain and single strain models to cumulative MERS-CoV cases, rather than to new cases.
       <sup>

       The procedure for model adjustment is as follows: for approaching near-operational predictions in each province, we followed former initiatives (e.g. on influenza[

       Using the model that provides the best prediction for the season total cases in the three provinces (i.e., a 2-strain model with BL incidence for Macca and the 2-strain model with SAT incidence for both Madina and Riyadh), we predicted the total number of cases in the following year. Using the parameter estimates in the last prediction point (i.e. 48
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       week) of the current season, we draw 1000 samples. Based on these parameter samples, we determined 1000 estimates of the season total cases in the next year[
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref043">
        43
       </xref>
       ]. We then defined a large outbreak in the forthcoming season in a particular region, as those events when cases exceeded the total number of cases in the previous season by more than one standard deviation (see
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g005">
        Fig 5
       </xref>
       ). Thus, the probability of a large outbreak (P
       <sub>
        l
       </sub>
       ) in those provinces isdetermined as the ratio of samples that exceed the total number of cases in a season divided by the total number of samples. We also considered the case when two strains of MERS-CoV may be co-circulating in the human population in Saudi Arabia. We also simulated the situation when one strain is assumed to be more active with a higher transmission rate, whilst the other is much less transmissible among individuals in the different provinces of Saudi-Arabia[
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref037">
        37
       </xref>
       ].Although we have considered two strains circulating in the community setting, we do not distinguish among strains in hospital premises. This is due to the lack of strain specific data in hospital settings. However, we are able to distinguish the contribution of infection from Community and Hospital setting by estimating the Community reproduction number (R
       <sub>
        C
       </sub>
       ) and the Hospital reproduction number (R
       <sub>
        H
       </sub>
       ). However, to account for this effect, we propose three different forces of infection (BL, NM and SAT) to model the MERS transmission in the three provinces. Saturated (SAT) functions describe “Crowding effects” in disease transmission, whereas Non-monotone (NM) functions are used to incorporate”psychological effects”. As the CFR in MERS-CoV is about 40%, it is easily expected that awareness in front of a MERS-CoV situation may play an important role during an epidemic[

       ]. Thus a model with such a crowding effect might seem a priori more realistic in comparison to the bilinear (BL) transmission (see also

        Fig 2

       ). The crowding effect in disease transmission[

       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g002">
        Fig 2
       </xref>
       ). This fact causes a lower number of new infections when a large number of infected individuals are already present in the community. This behavioral change in the susceptible population may occur due to, for instance, public health awareness campaigns and alerts raised by local or international authorities. The psychological effect is somewhat similar to the crowding effect, but with the effect of fear being added to the awareness. The psychological effect is stronger as the transmission rate decreases more rapidly with an increasing number of infected individuals (

       ] concluded that super-spreaders who visited multiple healthcare facilities drove up the epidemic by generating larger number of secondary cases. Therefore, we also consider the role of potential super-spreaders in the context of a 2-strain model with BL incidence function.

      Results and discussion
     </title>
     <p>
      Estimates of the transmission rates for the 2-strain model with BL incidence suggest that MERS-CoV transmission in the three locations is dominated by community and hospital transmission (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s001">
       S1 Table
      </xref>
      to
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s009">
       S9 Table
      </xref>
      ). The former statement is in good agreement with a previous study that suggested that MERS-CoV infections are essentially produced through both hospital and community based human-human transmission[
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref002">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. This fact is well reflected in the estimates of transmission rates obtained from the other two 2-strain models (e.g. NM and SAT incidence functions) for the three locations (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s001">

      (a measure of variability within the two strains) in Riyadh and Macca (see

      Tables) suggest that both strains are currently active in these provinces (albeit strain 2 contributes with only 3% - 50% to community human-human transmission). In Madina instead, a majority of the models (BL and NM) point to only one active strain,with strain 2 contributing less than 1% to community human-human transmission, see

      For each particular region in this study, two strain models are compared among themselves and also with regard to their single-strain counterparts in order to determine the best model (i.e. single, two-strain or a combination of other two-strain models). Results show that in the three locations, 2-strain models provide a better fitting to cumulative cases in comparison to their single strain counterparts (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g002">
       Fig 2
      </xref>
      ). AIC and BIC values for the 2-strain models suggest that the best model is region specific (best model for Riyadh is a 2-strain model with BL incidence, whereas in Macca and Madina the best models are both the model with a NM incidence function and the one incorporating super-spreaders, respectively; see
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s019">
       S19 Table
      </xref>
      ). We also compare our 2-strain models with a 2-strain model with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2). Comparing AIC and BIC values, we found that the models with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2) did not improve all the previous results (see
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s019">
       S19 Table
      </xref>
      ). Therefore, the best model among all 2-strain models cannot be determined solely from their goodness-of-fit comparison. For this reason, we additionally compared all the two-strain models on the basis of their respective prediction skills. Forecasts for the three models in Riyadh suggest that, a majority of the times, the 2-strain model with SAT incidence can better predict the three targets in comparison to the other two competing 2-strain models (e.g. note that for SAT the average of the mean absolute error, MAE, for peak week is 11.6, whereas for peak maximum is 24.83 and for season totals 55.62) (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0008065.t002">
       Table 2A
      </xref>
      ). For comparison, we also provide predictions in the province of Riyadh of the three targets using the model with super-spreaders. However, prediction with super-spreaders did not improve at all the former results obtained for Riyadh (see
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0008065.t002">
       Table 2A
      </xref>
      ). For Madina, both the peak week and season totals are better predicted by the same SAT 2-strain model (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 14.5 and 9.33 for season totals; see also
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">
       S22 Table
      </xref>
      ). However, when predicting the peak maximum in Madina, clearly the best model is the 2-strain model with the NM incidence function (i.e. MAE average for peak maximum being 2.62; see also
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">
       S22 Table
      </xref>
      ). For Macca, except for the peak week, the other two targets, namely peak maximum and season totals are better predicted with the 2-strain model with BL incidence (i.e. MAE average of 7.08 for peak maximum and of 63.42 for season totals, respectively; see
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">
       S22 Table
      </xref>
      ). For peak week in Macca, again a better prediction is achieved by the 2-strain model with SAT incidence (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 23.9, see
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">

      When comparing the three two strain models to their single-strain counterparts, composites of the mean absolute error (MAE) in Riyadh (

       Table 2A

      ) suggest that 2-strain models always outperform the single strain versions in predicting the three targets
      <italic>
       (
      </italic>
      i.e. peak week, peak maximum, and season totals). Averages of MAE for peak week, peak maximum and for season totals are 11.6, 24.83 and 55.62, respectively. This fact reinforces our earlier inference, confirming that there is more than one strain currently active in Riyadh. Among the single-strain models in Riyadh, the model with SAT incidence is found to have a better predictive capacity for the three targets in comparison to the other two single-strain models (
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s023">
       S23 Table
      </xref>
      ). In Macca instead, the single-strain model with SAT incidence provides better predictions of the peak week, the peak maximum and seasontotals in comparison to all the other models (see for instance MAE values in
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">

      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">
       S22 Table
      </xref>
      ). Conversely, in Madina, both 1-strain and 2-strain models with SAT incidence provide a similar performance in predicting the three targets (e.g. MAE for peak week 16.7 in comparison to 14.5, for peak maximum of 3.33 compared to 3.6 and for season totals of 5.87 against 9.33; see
      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">

      Tables). The latter may likely represent the best choice of models to form the basis of a future early-warning system for MERS-CoV prediction in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      The best model, selected on the basis of its capacity to derive skillful predictions, is the model with the SAT incidence function. We used this model to estimate the basic reproduction number, R

      , the community reproduction number, R
      <sub>

      , and the hospital reproduction number, R
      <sub>
       H
      </sub>
      , for the whole period of data available in those three provinces (

      <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s020">

      ). In all three provinces, R
      <sub>

      is estimated to be always greater than unity. In all three provinces, R
      <sub>

      is found out to be larger than R
      <sub>
       C

      . This implies, MERS-CoV transmission triggered from the hospital setting (see
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0008065.t002">
       Table 2B

      were also estimated from our BL 1-strain model in those same three provinces (see

       ](CFR 35.5%). This is an alarming situation as previous predictions on MERS-CoV had instead suggested that MERS-CoV might not sustain as an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula. The WHO report[
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref044">
        44
       </xref>
       ] suggests that MERS-CoV is still a relatively rare disease about which the medical personnel in health-care facilities have low awareness. Globally, MERS-CoV awareness is limited and because symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific, initial cases can be sometimes easily missed. With improved compliance in infection prevention and control, namely by stricter adherence to the standard precautions at all times, human-to-human transmission in health-care facilities can be reduced and even possibly eliminated with additional use of transmission-based precautions. In that regard, predictive mathematical models can help strengthen our understanding of both MERS-CoV transmission and control.

       In this study, we addressed the capacity of predictive mathematical models based on two-strain MERS-CoV configurations having different transmission functions. The models differed from each other in their force of infection and in how they cope with heterogeneity in transmission. Estimates of transmission rates suggest that community and hospital transmission are dominant in the case of 2-strain models in Riyadh, Macca and Madina. The majority of the 2-strain models suggest that MERS-CoV transmission is dominated by community and hospital human-human transmissions, a fact that reflects the actual transmission scenario in Saudi Arabia [

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref004">

       </xref>
       ]. Estimates of the parameter that measures transmission diversity between the two strains in the three provinces suggest that two strains are only active in Riyadh. This opposite trend in Riyadh in comparison to the other two provinces may be due to the fact that Riyadh is the capital city with good large health care facilities and a majority of the MERS-CoV patients in Saudi Arabia come to Riyadh for treatment[
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref002">
        2
       </xref>
       ]. These patients may therefore carry different MERS strains, ultimately leading to multiple strains being presently co-circulating in Riyadh. Similarly, Cotten et al.[
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0008065.ref037">
        37
       </xref>
       ] found that ancestors of most of the viral clades originated from Riyadh.
      </p>
      <p>
       We compared among the 2-strain models according to their predictive performance with regard to three targets (i.e. peak week, peak maximum and season totals). Our results suggest that among the three 2-strain models, the model with SAT incidence provides consistently skillful predictions and may be used to date as the best predictive model for MERS-CoV in Riyadh. Riyadh iswhere most of the MERS-CoV cases occur, while for the provinces of Macca and Madina, with lower reported MERS cases, it is difficult to determine the best model among the three 2-strain models. This fact justifies our earlier finding that in Riyadh two different strains are currently active and therefore the performance of the 2-strain models is better there. As per our results for Macca and Madina, only one dominant strain is active in those provinces. Therefore, predictions based on single strain models are there more appropriate. Our results also suggest that among the single strain models, those with SAT incidence always accurately predict the three targets for these two provinces. Thus, a dynamical MERS model considering this crowding effect is the most appropriate configuration to cope with the nature of MERS-CoV transmission.

       ) in most of the predictive weeks indicate that in a near future a large outbreak may be possible in those provinces. Out-of-fit predictions for the next season totals suggest that there is a high possibility of larger outbreaks in Macca and Riyadh. However, our results instead indicate that there is a very low possibility of larger outbreaks in Madina. The fact that this outbreak did not happen in 2017–2018 does not preclude what may occur in the forthcoming seasons. Under such a scenario, authorities and international health agencies should prepare and actively work towards the prompt implementation of cheap albeit efficient computational platforms ready to assist in the simulation of how a potential outbreak might evolve in the region. More so, given the high probability that another large MERS-CoV outbreak occurs in the Arabian Peninsula or nearby countries. Migration may also play a major role for increased transmission in the provinces of Saudi Arabia and this feature should be properly accounted for in future model configurations. In summary, our findings suggest that in a majority of provinces a single MERS-CoV strain is currently active, conversely to the situation in Riyadh. However, in the near future, it is also possible that more general MERS-CoV transmission occurs from multiple strains in other provinces of Saudi Arabia.

         The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) was assessed in an outbreak in Riyadh. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the HCWs and allow their return to duty.

        <p>
         Overall 17 out of 879 HCWS with different levels of exposure tested positive for MERS-CoV. Of the 15 positive HCWS with adequate follow-up, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling and 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling. The time to negative results among the 15 positive HCWs ranged between 4 and 47 days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance. All positive HCWs were either asymptomatic or had mild disease.

        <p>
         The data obtained in this study support the widespread testing of all close contacts of MERS-CoV cases, regardless of the significance of the contact or presence or absence of symptoms. In addition, urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of asymptomatic MERS-CoV-positive HCWs under investigation to active duty is needed.

      Introduction

     <p id="par0030">
      The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a pathogen of zoonotic reservoir that has caused many outbreaks in healthcare settings, involving many healthcare workers (HCWs) (

       Memish and Al-Tawfiq, 2014

      ). As of February 2018, a total of 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 750 deaths had been reported globally from 27 countries, including 12 countries of the Middle East (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0020">

      ). Emergency departments have been highlighted as the initial site of the spread of this virus in most of the recent outbreaks (

      A recent MERS-CoV outbreak occurred at King Saud Medical City (KSMC), concurrent with outbreaks at two other hospitals in the Riyadh region in June 2017 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0015">
       Amer et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). This study was performed to better understand the best strategies to handle exposed HCWs. The risk of transmission of MERS-CoV infection to HCWs in this outbreak was assessed and all available literature reviewed in an attempt to improve future preventive and post-exposure management interventions.

     <p id="par0040">
      A descriptive report on exposure criteria and screening results of HCWs acquiring MERS-CoV infection during the June 2017 outbreak at KSMC was produced. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal samples was used to test the traced contacts for MERS-CoV. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to stop their isolation and allow them to return to active duty. Further retesting depended on being symptomatic within the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period. Data were collected as part of the post-exposure management process.

      Results and discussion
     </title>
     <p id="par0045">
      Considering the super-spreading phenomenon of some of the reported positive MERS-CoV cases during the KSMC outbreak and because some of the cases had been intubated in a multi-bed room before being suspected and isolated, the tracing of contacts was very inclusive and included all persons who had been in attendance in the same area where the patient had stayed. A total of 1055 subjects were traced at the time: 879 HCWs and 176 patients. HCWs who had experienced high-risk unprotected exposure or had performed or attended aerosol-generating procedures (even if protected) were swabbed twice, while those who had experienced unprotected low-risk exposure and protected HCWs not attending aerosol-generating procedures were swabbed once. A total of 2000 swabs were collected during the outbreak period.
     </p>
     <p id="par0050">
      Overall 17 HCWS tested positive for MERS-CoV linked to four index cases. The first two index cases were super-spreaders, with the first case infecting nine exposed HCWs and the second index case infecting six exposed HCWs. The third and fourth index cases infected one HCW each. Two of the nine affected HCWs related to the first index case are not included in this report (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl0005">
       Table 1
      </xref>
      ). The activities undertaken by the infected HCWs ranged from mild exposure, e.g., exposure during routine nursing care, being in the same clinical area, or just having a simple peer conversation, to more high-risk exposure, e.g., intubation and connecting infected patients on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Of all the positive HCW contacts, 40% (6/15 HCWs) tested positive on the first sampling, 53% (8/15) tested positive on the second sampling, and only one HCW tested positive on the third sampling. Fortunately, none of the positive MERS-CoV HCWs had severe disease: 53% were asymptomatic and 46% had mild symptoms. The presence or absence of symptoms was found to be unrelated to the infected HCWs cycle threshold (CT) value. Among the 15 positive HCWs, the time to negative results ranged between 4 and 47 days (average 14.5 days) and the infected HCWs needed on average two samples for clearance.

      Over the last 5 years, since the virus emerged in September 2012, it has been found that the incubation period for MERS-CoV cases in whom exposure is known is between 5.5 and 6.5 days, and evidence suggests that the incubation period could be as long as 14 days. The infection control community continues to be challenged by the lack of updated evidence-based infection control guidelines for handling HCWs in contact with cases positive for MERS-CoV. Some of the key questions include: (1) Which of the exposed HCWs are at risk of acquiring MERS-CoV and need to be tested? (2) What exposure justifies testing? (3) Should asymptomatic contacts be screened? (4) Are asymptomatic positive HCWs infectious? (5) How many samples need to be taken for confirmation of positivity and clearance and how many days apart? (6) How long should HCWs be quarantined and when is it safe for them to return to active duty?
     </p>
     <p id="par0060">
      Although many reports of hospital outbreaks have been published to date, very few have discussed these key infection control questions in any detail. This is why national and international guidance on managing exposed HCWs has been inconsistent and sometimes confusing to the professional infection control community. The latest available guidance from the Saudi Ministry of Health published in 2017 still discourages the testing of asymptomatic HCWs and allows only one sample from HCWs who have had high-risk exposure to be cleared (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0040">
       Command and Control Center Ministry of Health Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Scientific Advisory Board, 2017
      </xref>
      ). Similarly, the latest US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance published in 2015 discourages the testing of asymptomatic contacts (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0035">
       CDC, 2015
      </xref>
      ).

      The World Health Organization (WHO), as always, has the most comprehensive guidance, which is balanced, evidence-based, considers the different levels of healthcare infrastructure, and most importantly is built on the consensus of expert opinion leaders from the six WHO regions. In their interim guidance released in June 2015, the WHO makes recommendations for inclusive testing in clusters/outbreaks associated with healthcare settings: “if feasible, all contacts of laboratory confirmed cases, especially HCW contacts and inpatients sharing rooms/wards with confirmed cases, regardless of the development of symptoms, should be tested for MERS-CoV using PCR” (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0055">
       WHO, 2018a
      </xref>
      ). In 2015, the WHO also provided guidance on the management of asymptomatic persons who were PCR-positive, and in January 2018 published updated recommendations (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0060">
       WHO, 2018b
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0065">
       WHO, 2018c
      </xref>
      ). In both documents the WHO states: “Until more is known, asymptomatic RT-PCR positive persons should be isolated, followed up daily for symptoms and tested at least weekly − or earlier, if symptoms develop − for MERS-CoV until a first negative test and then every 24–48 hours, releasing positive contacts only after 2 negative PCR results 24 hrs apart”.
     </p>
     <p id="par0070">
      Home versus hospital isolation of RT-PCR-positive persons depends on isolation bed capacity, the ability to monitor persons daily outside a healthcare setting, and the overall social conditions of the household and its occupants.

      Unfortunately, due to the lack of scientific evidence at the time of guideline development, the same WHO guidance documents give member states the conditional permission to return their asymptomatic PCR-positive HCWs to active duty if there are a significant number of asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive HCWs and concerns exist about keeping the healthcare system functioning for all patients during an outbreak. Clearance is bound by the following conditions, which are almost impossible to comply with and monitor in a healthcare facility with an ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak: there should be good infection control infrastructure in the facility, HCWs should not work in areas with patients at risk of MERS-CoV infection complications, and all positive HCWs should be monitored by repeat PCR testing for virus clearance and for compliance with good infection control practices, including wearing masks when within 1 meter of others (HCWS or patients). This component of the guidance needs to be revised based on the recent evidence showing possible transmission from asymptomatic PCR-positive HCWs, which could put patients and other HCWs at unnecessary risk if the conditions mentioned in the WHO document are not strictly applied and monitored (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0010">
       Alfaraj et al., 2018b
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p id="par0080">
      A recently published report from another hospital outbreak in Riyadh involving 153 HCW contacts with seven (4.5%) HCWs testing positive for MERS-CoV looked critically at the ideal infection control practices in handling HCWs in contact with positive cases (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0010">
       Alfaraj et al., 2018b
      </xref>
      ). The findings of that report are consistent with those of the present study, confirming the lack of relevance regarding the extent of exposure or presence or absence of symptoms among HCW contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV cases (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0010">
       Alfaraj et al., 2018b
      </xref>
      ). Both reports highlight the difficulties in ruling out positive HCWs from the first sample and stress the need for repeat sampling to confirm positivity and negativity. This report corroborates what has been published previously and calls for an urgent review and update of the available local and international guidance on handling HCWs in contact with MERS-CoV-positive cases and encourages critical monitoring of future outbreaks to answer any remaining infection control queries.
     </p>
     <p id="par0085">
      Five years after the emergence of the disease, significant new knowledge has been gained, but some gaps and challenges remain, including the definite source of infection and the exact routes of direct or indirect exposure, how to predict super-spreaders, clear guidance on handling exposed HCWS who can act as disease carriers spreading the disease to others, and finally how to detect cases early in the emergency room with the development of rapid, easy-to-use, highly sensitive and specific point-of-care testing.
     </p>
     <p id="par0090">
      In an effort to prevent any unnecessary risky exposure of HCWs and possibly compromising HCW and patient safety by propagating healthcare-associated outbreaks, the available evidence to date supports the 2015 WHO guidance in its call to be liberal in testing all ‘close contacts’ of MERS-CoV cases, regardless of the significance of contact or presence or absence of symptoms, as well as the need for repeat testing weekly until negative and every 24–48 h for release from isolation. In addition, urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of asymptomatic MERS-CoV-positive HCWs under investigation to active duty is needed. All public health guidelines, especially those addressing emerging pathogens of international public health importance, need to be regularly updated based on new scientific evidence; furthermore, areas of ambiguity need to be addressed with focused research initiatives by the countries affected.

        Summary
       </title>
       <p>
        Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is capable of causing acute respiratory illness. Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases may be asymptomatic, have mild disease, or have a life-threatening infection with a high case fatality rate. There are three patterns of transmission: sporadic community cases from presumed non-human exposure, family clusters arising from contact with an infected family index case, and healthcare-acquired infections among patients and from patients to healthcare workers. Healthcare-acquired MERS infection has become a well-known characteristic of the disease and a leading means of spread. The main factors contributing to healthcare-associated outbreaks include delayed recognition, inadequate infection control measures, inadequate triaging and isolation of suspected MERS or other respiratory illness patients, crowding, and patients remaining in the emergency department for many days. A review of the literature suggests that effective control of hospital outbreaks was accomplished in most instances by the application of proper infection control procedures. Prompt recognition, isolation and management of suspected cases are key factors for prevention of the spread of MERS. Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring of corrective measures contribute to changing the course of an outbreak. Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection.

      . MERS-CoV was first described in 2012 in a 60-year-old man hospitalized with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, who developed renal and respiratory failure, ultimately succumbing to progressive disease

      . However, a later retrospective analysis of a respiratory outbreak in a public hospital in Jordan determined that this cluster dated back earlier, becoming the first recognized healthcare-associated MERS-CoV infection in April 2012

      Although MERS-CoV has a documented ability to transmit between humans, especially in healthcare settings, there does not appear to be sustained human-to-human transmission. This is likely due to the relatively low reproduction number of MERS-CoV of 0.8–1.3

The upper reproduction estimates were probably derived from lack of sufficient infection control measures, and the estimates were lowered with improved detection and prevention practices over time.

      The World Health Organization continues to tally laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections. In the recent update from September 2012 to July 2017, there were 2040 cases with healthcare-associated infections (40 HCWs, patients and visitors), representing 31% of cases

      . The initial symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific, often thought to be pedestrian respiratory infections, and thus may go unnoticed. Adherence to standard precautions at all times, given the unpredictability of MERS-CoV infection, appears to be the critical factor for the prevention of transmission in healthcare facilities
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">

      . Additionally, environmental contamination may play a role in some transmission of MERS, as viral RNA has been detected for up to five days on surfaces

      . A well-characterized outbreak in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates offers insights into important infection control issues. The overwhelming reason for MERS-CoV spread centred on the delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV, as 93% of infected contacts were exposed before the patient's diagnosis. Also, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during care was inconsistent among these HCWs, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. Although improved PPE use would be of benefit, a larger preventative impact would be to place patients presenting with respiratory complaints and potential MERS-CoV infection in proper isolation with infection control practices until MERS-CoV infection is ruled out using the standard PCR diagnostic method.

      Protocols to address such patients in emergency departments or patients developing an apparent viral illness while hospitalized for other conditions should include the ability to rapidly isolate patients and run laboratory testing, which would likely mitigate spread within healthcare systems. Proper triaging of patients with acute respiratory illness is a fundamental step towards the application of a unified process to deal with such patients, as suggested by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

      . Despite such advice, not all healthcare systems in regions endemic for MERS-CoV or in non-endemic regions caring for a potentially infected traveller follow these steps. In a simulation of a ‘mystery’ infectious patient, 95 drills including 42 drills specifically for patients with possible MERS were conducted in 49 emergency departments in New York, USA. Hospitals were variable in the identification of potentially infectious patients and implementation of appropriate infection control measures, such as suboptimal adherence to hand hygiene, PPE use and isolation signage posting

      . An interesting observation of the outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection is the variability in intrahospital transmission of the virus.

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">

      What is the contribution of the persistence of the MERS-CoV virus in the environment to its spread? As an RNA virus, MERS-CoV survives surprisingly well on surfaces and in the air, especially at low temperature and low humidity

      </xref>
      . Sixty minutes after aerosolization, the virus remains infectious at 63.5% at 25 °C and 79% humidity, compared with only 4.7% at conditions 38 °C and 24% humidity

      . MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR and viral culture up to 18–27 days after symptom onset from most of the touchable environments in patients' rooms
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">

      . Bed controller devices and thermometers were PCR positive until five days after the last positive PCR result from the patient's respiratory specimen

      . MERS-CoV was cultured in four of seven air samples from patients' rooms, a restroom and a common corridor, and from 15 (22%) of 68 surface swabs
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">
       [37]

      . These data suggest that environmental cleaning needs to be meticulous, and that laboratory data may be required to prove adequate disinfection to allow discontinuation of isolation procedures. Further studies are required to assess infectious risks of the environment in the presence of molecularly detected MERS-CoV RNA.

      The prospect for control of MERS-CoV relies on multi-faceted programmes to educate HCWs on the disease, to identify potential patients early in their course of illness, to isolate suspected and confirmed cases appropriately, and to implement proper infection control (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">
       Table II
      </xref>
      ). The best prospect for MERS prevention and control rests on basic principles of infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Balkhy argues that three pillars are necessary: policies and procedures, facility and human resources, and accountability and leadership

      . How these goals could be achieved is demonstrated, in part, in one study using a core group of nurses for an education programme consisting of an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and hands-on practice to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs

      provides a summary of potential concern and possible interventions in infection prevention and control to halt MERS-CoV transmission with appropriate interventions. Some listed items are, by nature, parochial, including facility structure, knowledge and skills of HCWs, and patient-related issues. These can be individualized incorporating strategies that include education, feedback and tackling facility-related issues

      . In a survey of 607 HCWs, hospital infrastructure and design, staffing shortfalls, and absence of infection control training were cited as the primary contributing factors for the spread of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare facilities

      . In a study from Saudi Arabia of 228 trainees, half of the respondents indicated that their hospital had a clear plan while 28% did not feel that they were well prepared for MERS

      . There are notable challenges in diagnosis through laboratory and radiological methods, including the possibility of negative swab results by PCR methodology. Currently, the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection best relies on viral detection by RT-PCR

      . Lower respiratory samples have been shown to yield better diagnostic results than nasal or oral swabs. In two studies, lower respiratory samples showed higher Ct values than upper respiratory samples, and MERS-CoV virus was detected later in the course of the disease

      In conclusion, MERS-CoV, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), requires leadership insisting on formal and continued training of HCWs to be sufficiently prepared for emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Hospitals have varied in their ability to correctly identify potentially infectious patients and quickly implement appropriate infection control measures
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">
       [52]
      </xref>
      . Prompt recognition, isolation and management of the suspected cases are vital factors for the prevention of MERS transmission. It has been shown that MERS-CoV nucleic acid was detected by PCR in serum, faeces and urine

      . Thus, it is important to maintain proper infection control practices when caring for these patients.

     <p id="p0185">
      Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring implementation of corrective measures leading to constant readiness will change the course of an outbreak or halt it before it starts
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">
       [85]
      </xref>
      . Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">
       [86]
      </xref>
      . Healthcare facilities should take all the steps to learn from past experiences and build capacity for the prevention of outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and Ebola. Healthcare leadership and workers should strive to prevent future outbreaks. Failure to do so would mean that lessons learned from SARS, MERS and Ebola would be relegated to history, leaving patients, hospitals and HCWs vulnerable. Many infection control questions remain requiring further research, including a better understanding of the disease dynamics. Leading concerns include the role of asymptomatic individuals in transmission of the disease, and precise risk factors for transmission in healthcare facilities. Although data accrued have concentrated on respiratory transmission, the role of other body fluids and the built environment in transmission remains unknown. As zoonotic reservoirs for MERS-CoV may continue to produce sporadic human infections, rigorous infection control practices should prevent the virus from spreading past the hospital door.

        A year has passed since the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea. This 2015 outbreak led to a better understanding of healthcare infection control. The first Korean patient infected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was diagnosed on May 20, 2015, after he returned from Qatar and Bahrain. Thereafter, 186 Korean people were infected with the MERS-CoV in a short time through human-to-human transmission. All these cases were linked to healthcare settings, and 25 (13.5 %) infected patients were healthcare workers. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the MERS-CoV isolate found in the Korean patient was closely related to the Qatar strain, and did not harbor transmission efficiency-improving mutations. Nevertheless, with the same infecting virus strain, Korea experienced the largest MERS-CoV outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula, primarily due to the different characteristics of population density and the healthcare system. We aimed to review the epidemiological features and existing knowledge on the Korean MERS outbreak, and suggest methods to prevent future epidemics.

      The suspected transmission route for human Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was a direct contact with the saliva of infected camels, or through consumption of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. Kayali et al. showed that the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV was several times higher in persons with regular exposure to camels than in the general population [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. Further, Muller et al. reported a 15- and 23-times higher seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in shepherds and in slaughterhouse workers, respectively, compared with the general population [

      Person-to-person transmission of zoonotic disease has been reported for only a limited number of diseases [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">

      ]. However, some experts have suggested the occurrence of secondary infections through droplets, or direct contact with infected patients or fomites [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. Furthermore, an epidemiological study reported the potential for MERS-CoV nosocomial transmission through contaminated surfaces of bed sheets, bed controllers, bedrails, medical devices, and even air-ventilation equipment [

      Although the school-going children of the community were not initially a suspected at-risk population for virus transmission, growing public fear finally resulted in closure of more than 1,160 kindergartens, schools, and even some universities. During this time, people riding subways, buses, and other public transports while wearing face masks, was a common sight. Increasing public fear resulted in cancellation of social meetings, and the downtowns were no longer crowed [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
       13

      ]. However, there still are no strong evidences supporting MERS spread in community-settings, and therefore, the usefulness of these social efforts to prevent MERS spread in the community remains uncertain.

      Super-spreading events: epidemiological perspective
     </title>
     <p>
      Chowell et al. suggested that a few early super-spreading events fueled the MERS outbreak in Republic of Korea [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       1
      </xref>
      ]: the index patient who infected 30 secondary cases, and another two second generation cases who infected 80 and 23 secondary cases, respectively (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
       Fig. 1
      </xref>
      ). These cases were termed as "super-spreaders," while the vast majority of cases induced relatively few secondary infections. According to some researchers, super-spreading events follow the 20/80 rule [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
       14
      </xref>
      ], where approximately 20% of the infected individuals are responsible for 80% of the transmissions. Moreover, Lloyd-Smith et al. reported that super-spreading is a normal feature of disease transmission [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
       15
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      Stein et al. summarized the contributing factors resulting in a super-spreader as follows: pathogen's virulence factors, co-infections, decreased host immunity, misdiagnosis, delayed hospital admission, inter-hospital transfers, host behaviors such as ignoring instructions regarding infection control, and poor environmental conditions such as crowding, poor ventilation, etc. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
       16
      </xref>
      ]. An observational, laboratory-based study of outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh reported that the MERS super-spreading events and the observed overdispersion of MERS transmission may similarly result from a combination of factors, including individual viral shedding and contact rates, hospital procedures and locations, as well as population structure and density [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
       17
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      Predicting super-spreading events is thus very important in infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
       16
      </xref>
      ]. However, it may be difficult to identify the super-spreaders before the onset of an epidemic. In both the French [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
       9
      </xref>
      ] and the German MERS-CoV cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
       18
      </xref>
      ], which had similar findings listed above, the exposed healthcare workers did not get infected, although appropriate infection-protection measures were not in place. In the Korean outbreak as well, some non-super-spreaders had similar conditions to those favoring super-spreading events: high viral titer, delayed awareness, narrow and crowded rooms, and unprotected close contact such as intubation. Despite this, no confirmed secondary cases were found amongst thousands of exposed persons (data not published). The consequence of this discrepant transmission can be summarized in a statement by Galvani and May, "heterogeneously infectious emerging disease will be less likely to generate an epidemic, but if sustained, the resulting epidemic is more likely to be explosive" [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">

      Risks of death and the implication of infection control
     </title>
     <p>
      A Korean MERS outbreak epidemiological study was undertaken to estimate the case fatality rate (CFR) among senior patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
       19
      </xref>
      ]. The CFR for patients aged 60 years or older, with underlying diseases, was estimated at 48.2 %, as of July 31, 2015. The estimated CFR among other cases were as follows: 1.8 % in the lowest risk group (age &lt; 60 years without any underlying diseases); 13.6 % for those aged 60 years or older, without any underlying diseases; and 11.1 % for those younger than 60 years, with underlying diseases. Senior patients were thus 9.3-fold (95 % CI, 5.3–16.9) more likely to die compared to younger patients, while presence of underlying diseases resulted in a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0–16.7) higher likelihood of fatality [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
       19
      </xref>
      ]. Although the researchers were not able to ensure a systematic and consistent review of all common comorbidities, these findings showed that enhanced hospital infection control practices, protecting the specific at-risk groups from MERS exposure, were very important to reduce associated mortality.

      Weakness of the Korean health care system in infection control
     </title>
     <p>
      The health care system of Republic of Korea is a very unique structure, in which a 39 year-old universal social welfare system; the utilitarian "National Health Insurance System (NHIS)"; and competitive private clinics and hospitals miraculously co-exist. The efficiency of the Korean medical insurance system is among the highest in the world, having even numerous mega-sized hospitals running at relatively low medical costs. Although the reimbursement system of the medical costs are public, there is no limitation to hospital use in different regions, and relatively few restrictions exist in choosing from large university hospitals or tertiary care centers. Thus, patients can select a medical institution they want to visit, and move easily from one hospital to another. Further, even though accurate transfer notes are mandatory, the patient management and clinical testing information are not adequately shared by the referring hospitals. These factors may make hospital-to-hospital infection transmission more common [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
       20
      </xref>
      ]. In addition, with an aim to restrict over-charging by individual institutions, medical expenditures including institutional safety-related expenditures are strictly controlled by the Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service (HIRA). Consequently, more than 50% of the hospital rooms in Korea have more than 4 beds per room, and family members or privately hired health care aides usually stay with the patients in theses crowded hospital rooms. This situation has not been ameliorated with the recently built large-sized university hospitals, and this increased vulnerability to easier viral transmission as a result of overcrowding has long been considered a common occurrence at the larger hospitals [

      Future prevention strategies against MERS CoVlike situation in Korea
     </title>
     <p>
      How can Korean healthcare institutions, with high population density, be better prepared against MERS-CoV-like outbreaks? This question is even more pertinent for large well-constructed hospitals, operating in relatively resource limited settings in terms of safety issues; availability of adequate space; and number of healthcare workers, that cater to severe cases including the critically ill patients. To prevent future infectious disease outbreaks in Korea, several strategies might be adopted, and are summarized as below. These strategies should include not only individual institution-level preparedness, but also the entire healthcare system. Debates are expected on prioritization of infection safety.
     </p>
     <sec>
      <title>
       1. A higher index of alerting system to find the source-patient earlier
      </title>
      <p>
       In the Korean MERS outbreak, a number of cases could not be suspected in the first hospital visit, as early clinical manifestations of MERS are non-specific. Consequently, significant secondary exposures were provoked unconsciously. Drostein et al. suggested that viral spread may have been limited by awareness of the disease among healthcare workers and patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
        17
       </xref>
       ]. Therefore, an efficient alerting system, including proper education on newly spreading diseases to the healthcare workers is necessary. In addition, medical providers must adopt a mandatory travel history checking policy when screening patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms. Thereon, systems to share adequate medical information between hospitals should be established.
      </p>
     </sec>
     <sec>
      <title>
       2. Appropriate numbers of airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) should be constructed and maintained
      </title>
      <p>
       The US's Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the AIIRs should be single, negative pressure, patient rooms, with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour. CDC also recommends a direct discharge of air from these rooms to the outside, or filtration through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Before the MERS outbreak, the Korean government prepared a total of 119 negative pressure beds. However, many of these did not meet the recommended criteria, and some were not even built as single patient rooms [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">
        21
       </xref>
       ]. The resultant shortage of AIIRs meant that not all MERS suspected patients were isolated at the peak of the Korean outbreak. Furthermore, AIIRs and specialized healthcare settings were also disproportionately distributed between public and private hospitals. Thus, as newly built AIIRs were concentrated in public hospitals under local government, most advanced healthcare facilities and critical care personnel were linked to large sized private university hospitals. During the outbreak, many public hospitals had to recruit medical personnel from university and army hospitals, and also volunteer nurses.

       3. Donning &amp; doffing; proper training on putting on and take off "Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)"
      </title>
      <p>
       CDC's PPE recommendation are as follows [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
        22
       </xref>
       ]: "Workers must receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE; what PPE is necessary; how to properly don (put on), use, doff (take off) PPE; how to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain PPE; and the limitations of PPE. Any reusable PPE must be properly cleaned, decontaminated, and maintained after and between uses." During the Korean MERS epidemic, although doctors and nurses used PPE, some of them were infected with MERS-CoV. Even as the reasons for infection in these healthcare workers were uncertain, some epidemiologic researchers attributed this to inadequate use of PPE.
      </p>
     </sec>
     <sec>
      <title>
       4. Well-trained healthcare workers to care for patients infected with highly contagious pathogens must be fostered
      </title>
      <p>
       During the Korean MERS outbreak, only a few doctors and nurses at each healthcare facility were engaged in MERS patients care. The number of infectious diseases specialists was less than 200 for the 50 million Korean people at the time of the 2015 MERS outbreak. This resulted in overworked healthcare professionals, which could be a threat for both the healthcare workers and the patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
        23
       </xref>
       ]. The Korean government plans to increase the numbers of infection control and epidemiology professionals, and establish specialized infectious diseases hospitals. However, this seems to be a half successful measure, since the numbers of trained specialists, that existing societies and educational associations could certificate annually, are far from the goal.
      </p>
     </sec>
     <sec>
      <title>
       5. Crowded and narrow hospital rooms should be converted to visitor controlled larger-spaced hospital rooms
      </title>
      <p>
       Almost all secondary infected Korean MERS cases were patients, healthcare workers, or visiting family members, who were exposed to source patients in crowded hospital environments such as multiple occupancy rooms and emergency rooms. These close personal contacts may allow easy transmission of MERS-CoV. Therefore, stronger policies need to be in place to initially maintain patients with acute febrile and/or respiratory illness in single patient rooms (preemptive isolation), followed by a move to multiple occupancy room, depending on infectiousness. Moreover, regulations and restrictions on visiting acquaintances in hospital are also needed. Thus, even as visiting sick family members of friends in hospital is a friendly way to express social relationship for Koreans for long time, this culture should be modified to better prevent catastrophic contagious diseases.

      Conclusion
     </title>
     <p>
      Last year, struggling with an unfamiliar syndrome, the Korean healthcare system was unable to find infected cases in time, and to react quickly and accurately as the first imported case was reported. Multiple potential factors were associated with the super-spreading events: misdiagnosis, delayed hospital admission, inter-hospital transfers without accurate information, and also behaviors such as ignoring instructions regarding infection control, and poor environmental conditions. Institutional and healthcare system's preparedness is required to prevent such outbreaks. Efforts to halt transmission of infectious diseases need to be prioritized and should include: reviewing existing recommendations, improved contact tracing policy, improved public hospital facilities for critical care of severe infections, and pre-emptive isolation for unknown acute respiratory infection. These strategies are crucial to prepare for a future MERS-like epidemic in Korea.

        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic virus considered as one of the major public threat with a total number of 2 298 laboratory-confirmed cases and 811 associated deaths reported by World Health Organization as of January 2019. The transmission of the virus was expected to be from the camels found in Middle Eastern countries via the animal and human interaction. The genome structure provided information about the pathogenicity and associated virulent factors present in the virus. Recent studies suggested that there were limited insight available on the development of novel therapeutic strategies to induce immunity against the virus. The severities of MERS-CoV infection highlight the necessity of effective approaches for the development of various therapeutic remedies. Thus, the present review comprehensively and critically illustrates the recent aspects on the epidemiology of the virus, the structural and functional features of the viral genome, viral entry and transmission, major mechanisms of pathogenesis and associated virulent factors, current animal models, detection methods and novel strategies for the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV. The review further illustrates the molecular and computational virtual screening platforms which provide insights for the identification of putative drug targets and novel lead molecules toward the development of therapeutic remedies.

      The coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 (α-coronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 (β-coronavirus) circulated in the human population and caused mild respiratory infections (

     <p>
      The first case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">
       Zaki et al., 2012
      </xref>
      ). From the period of its emergence, the virus has infected and propagated across more than 20 countries, contributing to a wide number of laboratory-confirmed cases. In 2015, the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea involved 186 cases which included 38 fatalities. A total of 83% cases of transmission were due to five super spreaders, and 44% of 186 cases were in the patients those who were experienced nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government authorities quarantined 16,993 persons for 14 days to manage the outbreak. This outbreak provides an exclusive opportunity to seal the gap in our awareness of MERS-CoV infection (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">
       Oh et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). Recent statistics suggested that as of 31 December 2018, the total of 2,279 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV with 806 associated deaths (case fatality rate: 35.4%) were reported in 27 countries [

     <p>
      In a comprehensive report by WHO, 1841 laboratory cases were confirmed between 2012 and 2016 in which 80% of them were reported from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The remaining cases were reported from 27 countries in Middle East, Asia, North Africa, United States of America, and Europe [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">
       World Health Organization (WHO), 2016a
      </xref>
      ]. A total of 13 cases were reported between October to November 2017, amongst which 12 cases were reported in male and only one case was reported in female. Most of the infected individuals were hospitalized due to the contact with camels and consumption of camel milk with the virus [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154">
       World Health Organization (WHO), 2017a

      The Genome of MERS-CoV
     </title>
     <p>
      In the early years of 2000, coronaviruses were not acquired great importance in research and development. With the emergence of SARS in the year 2002 and MERS in 2012, the interest of many researchers was stimulated toward coronavirus (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">
       Perlman, 2015
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The morphology of coronavirus includes spherical or pleomorphic shapes with a diameter of 80–120 nm (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">
       Masters, 2006
      </xref>
      ). The genome of the coronavirus consists of 6 and 7 open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF 1a and 1b encompass two-third of the viral genome which encodes the non-structural poly-proteins and the other four ORFs on the downstream side encode for the structural proteins such as envelope protein (E), Spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), and membrane protein (M). In some coronaviruses, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene is present in the region between ORF 1b and S (

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">
       Snijder et al., 2003
      </xref>
      ). These structural proteins are folded and entered in to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the ER-Golgi transitional slot (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">
       Masters, 2006
      </xref>
      ). During the replication of coronavirus, substantial amounts of structural proteins are synthesized in order to assemble the progeny virions (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">
       Fung and Liu, 2014
      </xref>
      ). They occupy the RNA genome which encodes structural proteins such as S protein, M protein, and N protein (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">
       Snijder et al., 2003

      ).

      The genome size of the first imported MERS-CoV strain was identified to be 30,114 nucleotide (nt) long, including the 3′and 5′ UTRs. This strain showed the genome structural ornaisation of typical betacoronavirus such as a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (nt 1 to 272), replicase complex ORF1ab (nt 273 to 21508), S gene (nt 21450 to 25511), ORF3 (nt 25526 to 25837), ORF4a (nt 25846 to 26175), ORF4b (nt 26087 to 26827), ORF5 (nt26834 to 27508), E gene (nt 27584 to 27832), M gene (nt 27847 to 28506), N gene (nt 28560 to 29801), ORF8b gene (nt 28756 to 29094), and 3′UTR (nt 29094 to 30114). The two main poly-proteins such as

      are cleaved into 15/16 non-structural proteins (nsp) by 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). These proteases are cleaved from

      </italic>
      along with other ORFs encoding nsp which are essential for activating RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, exo-ribonuclease, endo-ribonuclease, and methyltransferase. These nsp were identified to be nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16. The nsp14 is necessary for proofreading the ubiquitous mutation of RNA virus (

      ). Studies revealed that the accessory ORF proteins play an important role in MERS-CoV infection and pathogenesis (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">
       Menachery et al., 2017
      </xref>
      ). This study showed that the absence of major accessory ORFs such as deletion of ORF3, -4a, -4b, and -5 (dORF3-5) played major role in the viral replication and pathogenesis. Further, the attenuation of the mutant dORF3-5 was found to be responsible for the dysregulated host responses such as augmented interferon (IFN) pathway activation, disrupted cell processes, and robust inflammation. Thus, the disruption of accessory ORFs probably provide platform to the attenuation of future emergent strains of MERS-CoV accessory ORF mutants. The accessory ORF functions can be targeted for both therapeutic and vaccine treatments in response to MERS-CoV and related group 2C corona viruses (

      An interesting fact of coronaviruses is that they display recombination, high rates of mutation, and propensity to cross species. One such event was reported during the 2002–2003 epidemic, where the transmission of SARS-CoV has occurred from Chinese horseshoe bats to human populations (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">
       Perlman and Netland, 2009

      ). MERS-CoV has the capability to adjust new environments and acquire various virulence factors and enhance their ability to transfer these factors from human-to-human due to continues outbreak (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">
        Xia et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). The RBD of MERS-CoV consists of S1 subunit which ranged from 367 to 606 amino acids and can be grouped into an external sub domain and core domain as shown in
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">

       . The receptor-binding motif, V484 – L567 of RBD is situated at the external sub domain and the core sub domain consists of anti-parallel β-sheet (five-stranded) and six helices in the center. The two small β-strands make a globular fold. The core domain structure is balanced by three disulfide linkages. The MERS-CoV RBD external sub domain contains a β-sheet along with one small and three large strands which are organized in anti-parallel manner. The RBD core is attached to this region by special intervening loops and it binds to the core sub-domain by a clamp at the lower and upper regions. Most of the connecting loops and two small

       helices are located in the inner region of the sheet. The fourth disulfide linkage is stabilized among the residues starting from C503 to C526 and β6-strand linked with η3-helix. Three helices (HR1) at the center and three chains (HR2) near to the core promote the release of the viral particle into the cytoplasm and promote the progression of the infection (

The host protease cleaves coronavirus S protein into two functional domains distinctive to each other at the N-terminal region (denoted as the S1 subunit) which comprised of RBD, and C-terminal portion (S2 subunit) comprised of a fusion peptide, two heptad repeats (HR2 and HR1) and the transmembrane (TM) domain (

       ). The membrane fusion is conciliated by main conformational rearrangement which exposed the fusion peptide resulting in the development of six-helix bundle (6HB). The core of 6HB consists of a triple-stranded coiled like structure constructed by HR1s of the three spike subunits forming trimers; the HR2 elements are found to be packed within the grooves of the coiled coil in an anti-parallel direction. Owing to their central role in membrane fusion, it was reported that various antiviral peptides interfere the formation 6HB (

Hematological aberrations delineated for the clinical cases of neutrophilia (8%), lymphopenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and lymphocytosis (11%).

       While there were intensive studies on coronavirus research over the past 5 years, limited reports are available on the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. Recent post-mortem histopathological studies revealed that the localization of viral particles in the pulmonary and extra pulmonary tissue of a 33-year-old male patient of T cell lymphoma, who acquired MERS-CoV infection (

       ). The histopathological analysis of the biopsies were collected from lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle demonstrated that there were pulmonary diffuse alveolar damage, necrotizing pneumonia, acute kidney injury, portal and lobular hepatitis and myositis with muscle atrophic changes. Further, the viral particles were found to be localized in the pulmonary macrophages, pneumocytes, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles (

       Studies suggested that the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in human and animals are mainly due to three mechanisms such as DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) mediated mechanism, papain like protease PLpro mediated mechanism and accessory proteins like p4a and membrane M protein mediated mechanism. Hence, these proteins are probably considered as one of the potential therapeutic targets for MERS-CoV infections (

      DPP4 Mediated Mechanism

     <p>
      DPP4 is a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein consists of approximately 766 amino acids and function as major receptor for MERS-CoV. The three dimensional structural analysis revealed that this receptor has α/β-hydrolase domain and a β-propeller domain with eight blades that helped in the binding of receptor binding domain in MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">
       Raj et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ). The crystal structure of DPP4 is illustrated in
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">
       Figure 1C
      </xref>
      . A DPP4 binding protein, adenosine deaminase, is considered as one of the major inhibitors of the S protein of MERS-CoV (

      A number of cell lines such as human-derived HFL, Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7, HEK, His-1 cell lines, CD8+, and CD4+ that are susceptible to MERS-CoV were reported (

      ). Two S protein ecto-domains can be divided into fusion-catalyzing domains (FD) and RBD. The S RBDs bind to DPP4 after which the FDs are exposed through unfolding. Further, the cellular and viral membranes were joined together by refolding (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">
       Raj et al., 2013
      </xref>
      ). The unfolding FD required the cleavage of S protein by host proteases. Out of various proteolytic cleavage sites between the FD and RBD, the cleavage at S1/S2 site is essential for the infection of Calu3 cells by MERS-CoV (

      Accessory Proteins Mediated Mechanism

      The viral genome is recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">

      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of MDA5 and RIG-1, MERS-CoV used the protein such as 4a (p4a) which contain RNA-binding motif for binding (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">
       Rabouw et al., 2016
      </xref>
      ). By a direct binding, this motif masks the dsRNA of MERS-CoV. The p4a possesses αβββα fold with the β1-β2 loop and α1 helix which bind to the minor groove of dsRNA. The mutational studies revealed that p4a-dsRNA complex stabilized by the amino acids such as K27, W45, K63, and K67 (

      suggested that, NF-κB remained in the cytoplasm of MERS-CoV infected cells while 4b was found to be attached with the nucleus. In the absence of 4b, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed as NF-κB translocated to the nucleus. This was also observed in the case of 4b mutants that devoid of nuclear localization signal, indicating that nuclear localization signal mediated process of 4b is essential for NF-κB expression (

      As a component of the viral envelope, M protein is involved in various functions such as viral assembly along with other proteins such as E, S, N. The M, E, and S proteins interact with N protein in the ER-Golgi complex. This interaction hinders the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">
       Mustafa et al., 2018

This reaction was detected to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), however, not activated the nuclear factor-κB. The interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 and the association of disrupted TRAF3–TBK1 lead to reduced activation of IRF3 (

      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus can readily infect human respiratory epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and can influence the production and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (

      human lung tissue and respiratory epithelial cell lines showed that the induction of antiviral interferons followed by MERS-CoV infection by stimulated epithelial cells was found to be limited. A study by

       Menachery et al. (2014)
      </xref>
      described that the cells infected with MERS-CoV demonstrated distinctly altered chromatin structures such as repressive histone markers, that could limit the transcription factors from binding to the promoter regions of interferon-stimulated gene. The changes in DNA methylation found to be one of the reasons for down regulation of IFN-γ–associated antigen-presenting gene after the infection (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">
       Menachery et al., 2018

      ). MERS-CoV proteins such as 4a, 4b, M, and PLpro were found to be suppressed the induction of interferons (

      ). Further, the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine response in these cells was found to be limited. A delayed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β were observed upon the viral infection (

      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus could infect and replicate in human monocyte-derived macrophages and immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells, while it failed to perform similar functions in mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells. This indicate that the maturation restrict the viral replication. Immature dendritic cells were unable to stimulate T-cell even after the antigen uptake, delaying the activation of T-cells and permitting further viral replication (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
       Cong et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). The infection of human macrophages induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as MCP-1/CCL-2, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, MIP-1α/CCL-3, IP-10/CXCL-10, RANTES/CCL-5, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-6 (

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
       Cong et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). The infected dendritic cells induced the expression of IL-12, RANTES/CCL-5, IP-10/CXCL-10 and IFN-γ, however, showed low expression of IFN-α and no expression of IFN-β (

      ).
     </p>

      T-cells can be directed to the infection site by type-I IFN stimulated secretion of IL-10 and CXCL10. Due to their uncontrolled and strong expression, the expression of IFN-γ and IL-12 were inhibited and restricted the activation of T-helper cells. With the added effect of down-regulated antigen-presentation pathways, the activation of T cells is inhibited. Hence, the sequestered T cells failed to target the virus (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B162">
       Ying et al., 2016
      </xref>
      ). Previous studies revealed that when the serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage were analyzed from two patients, it was observed that the patients with low level secretion of IFN-α were failed to survive and the patients displayed high level secretion of type-I IFN were survived (

      Animal Models
     </title>
     <p>
      The animal models are one of the vital components for translation of the findings from drug discovery process from bench to bedside. These animal models are indispensable for the deeper understanding of any diseases and safe and protective vaccine development process (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">
       Lorenzen et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). The main criteria for the validation of animal models in preclinical studies are face validity, predictive validity and target validity. The face validity means that the proper similarity between the animal model and the human disease in terms of the biology and symptoms of the disease. However, assessing face validity is a tedious task due to the lack of understanding on the core biology of the disease symptoms. Predictive validity means the display of clinical interventions which exhibited similar effect in the animal models. This is also very difficult to achieve due to the incomplete correlation between animal models, the mechanism of human diseases and the incapability of standard drugs to active in many animal models. Target validity is another essential component for the validation of animal models in which the target under study must have an analogous function in the disease model as in the clinical condition (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">
       Denayer et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      An ideal animal model is the one where an immunocompetent animal, on receiving the challenge virus at a realistic dose through a suitable inoculation route, is able to replicate the characteristics of a human disease as closely as possible (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
       Doremalen and Munster, 2015
      </xref>
      ). Ferrets, hamsters, mice and other small laboratory animals are not ideal animal models for MERS-CoV owing to the variations in DPP4 receptor. The rhesus macaque and the common marmoset are the first non-human primate species (NPS) to be used as the animal models for MERS-CoV. Glycosylation of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) prevents its binding to S protein of MERS-CoV. Hence, transgenic hDPP4 (human DPP4) mice were developed as animal model (

       Recent studies suggested that the transgenic mice models were developed where the full-length mDPP4 gene replaced by hDPP4 (

        Coleman et al., 2017

       The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools were used to produce mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection by modifying their genome sequence (positions 288 and 330) homologous to the sequence of hDPP4. In certain mice model the characteristic symptoms such as pulmonary hemorrhage, low survival, decreased pulmonary function and weight loss were observed. The 288-330+/+MERS-CoV mouse model demonstrated severe respiratory infection as observed in humans (

The lungs of the infected marmosets demonstrated widespread pulmonary oedema and hemorrhaging. The oedematous alveolar cavities showed fibrinous exudates and neutrophil infiltration. In both the cases, DPP4 was widely expressed in alveolar macrophages and type-I and II pneumocytes were also actively involved.

       revealed that the infected New Zealand rabbits were developed asymptomatic pulmonary infections with high levels of viral antigens and RNA. Multiple lung lobes showed peri-vascular inflammation. The antibodies developed by the rabbits lacked neutralizing activity, and as a result the animals were susceptible to re-infection. In fact, enhanced pulmonary inflammation was observed after re-infection. However, re-infection elicited the neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). Hence, it was suggested that upon re-infection, there might be greater risk of severe lung disease in those who do not develop neutralizing antibody response, or those whose neutralizing antibody titers have decreased after the initial infection (

      Diagnostic Approaches
     </title>
     <p>
      The primary diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was performed by molecular techniques such as real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">
       Corman et al., 2012a
      </xref>
      ), reverses transcription–loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-RTPA) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">
       Shirato et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ) and reverses transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-LAMP) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       Abd et al., 2013
      </xref>
      ). Numerous serological assays were used to detect MERS-CoV or closely related viruses in seropositive camels; these tests were protein microarrays like indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recombinant spike immunofluorescent assay, spike pseudoparticle neutralization and microneutralization assay (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
       Buchholz et al., 2013
      </xref>
      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">
       Perera et al., 2013
      </xref>
      ). However, none of the serological assays showed evidence of the precise occurrence of MERS-CoV in camels (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">
       Song et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). Recent study reported that a rapid and specific assay for the detection of MERS-CoV such as nucleic acid visualization technique which combine the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">
       Huang et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). The study suggested that in comparison with the real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) method recommended by the World Health Organization, the RT-LAMP-VF assay is easy to perform and the rapid detection of MERS-CoV within 35 min was achieve by this approach (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">
       Huang et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      An assay was developed based on the detection of N protein of MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">
       Song et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). The NP protein preferred as better target than the S protein. In this type of assay, firstly, the antigen binds to gold labeled monoclonal antibodies which lead to the formation of antigen-antibody complex. The complex further passed through nitrocellulose membrane and bind to monoclonal antibody at the test region and formed band which could be conveniently analyzed (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">
       Tang, 2014
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Currently, multiple purified monoclonal antibodies are available in clinical and preclinical studies for the development of antimicrobials (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">
       Rockx et al., 2010
      </xref>
      ). Studies suggested that two human antibodies (REGN3048 and REGN3051) are known to bind with MERS-CoV RBD and prevent the interaction of cellular receptor DPP4 with S protein and effectively neutralize MERS-CoV infection (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">
       Pascal et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). The antibodies such as REGN3048 and REGN3051 showed no binding with S protein, thus, employed as effective combination for inhibiting MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
       Aderem et al., 2011
      </xref>
      ). REGN3048 and REGN3051 co-interact with MERS-CoV RBD, which suggested that these antibodies bind to discrete epitopes as they bind to regions of MERS-CoV S protein that are conserved during the natural evolution of the virus. These two antibodies were blocked entry of the virus into susceptible cell lines and neutralize the infection (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">
       Pascal et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The diagnostically relevant variations in the neutralization activity have not been detected in several isolates of MERS-CoV. In order to detect the serological response to a specific type of single MERS-CoV serotype, specific protein based sero-assays are essential to be performed (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">
       Muth et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). The development of potential serological assays demand well delineated human or animal sera and antibodies specific to MERS-CoV (

      Vaccines and Therapeutics
     </title>
     <p>
      Previous studies revealed that both cellular and humoral responses are required for the complete protection against MERS-CoV infections (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">
       Faure et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ;

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">
       Corman et al., 2016
      </xref>
      ). Nabs and T-cell responses are the main agents in providing protective immunity against coronaviruses. In a study by
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">
       Zhao et al. (2014)
      </xref>
      reported that MERS-CoV cleared by mice which lack B-cells while those deficient in T-cells failed to perform similar functions. Further, since virus-specific humoral responses were decreased over time, developing a vaccine which could induce long-lived memory T-cell response considered to be beneficial. However, any vaccine compounds which are able to induce both T and B-cell responses are required for immune protection (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">

       Current Vaccine and Antiviral Candidates
      </title>
      <p>
       MERS-CoV vaccine candidates are still under development with DNA based, protein based, live attenuated and vectored-virus based vaccines (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
        Arabi et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Out of the four structural proteins and sixteen non structural proteins encoded by the viral genome, S protein showed the highest immunogenicity which induced T-cell responses. In most of the MERS-CoV, Nabs target the RBD of the S protein. The variations in amino acid sequences of the S protein detected amongst MERS-CoV is limited, thus, designing a vaccine against one strain most likely to be protected against all the other circulating strains (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">
        Okba et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). The S1 protein located outside the RBD probably considered as potential drug target to develop therapeutic strategies against MERS-CoV. RBD-specific mAbs are considered to be displayed greater neutralizing activity than those were targeted the S1 or S2 region outside RBD (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">
        Du et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       DPP4-targeting therapeutic agents are capable of blocking the interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4, and therefore inhibit MERS-CoV infection. The anti-DPP4 (CD26) antibodies such as 1F7, 2F9, and YS110 prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into susceptible cells, obstructing the virus infection (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">
        Ohnuma et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). Additionally, DPP4-binding protein adenosine deaminase (ADA) competes the binding with MERS-CoV RBD to DPP4, specifically at crucial residues such as Q286 and L294, defining their role as a naturally occurring antagonist (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">
        Raj et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent studies revealed that the DNA vaccines are the safest vaccines for immune-compromised patients. They possessed comparatively greater amounts of DNA (e.g., 0.5–2 mg) thus requires multiple inoculations to induce potent immune responses in rhesus macaques and mice (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">
        Wirblich et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ).
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">
        Chi et al. (2017)
       </xref>
       developed a DNA vaccine which encoded the first 725 amino acids of S protein in MERS-CoV which induced the cell mediated and antigen-specific humoral immune responses in mice. Post three immunizations, it was observed that high titers of Nabs (up to 1: 104) were produced without any adjuvant. A prophylactic DNA-plasmid vaccine known as GLS-5300, which encodes for S protein, is the first MERS-CoV vaccine to be considered for the human trials developed by GeneOne Life Inc., which has been enlisted in the on-going list of vaccines by WHO [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccines that imitate the natural infection, such as recombinant viral vectors or live-attenuated virus present the antigens in natural ways which further stimulate the activation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to the native protein conformation. As the live attenuated viruses have been the most immunogenic platforms available, they exhibited the capability to present numerous antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">
        Henderson and Moss, 1999
       </xref>
       ).
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
        Agrawal et al. (2016)
       </xref>
       vaccinated the mice with an inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine and which demonstrated hypersensitivity risk factors in MERS-CoV infection. Although there were extensive research in the last few years, limited anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics have been approved for human use. Originally, conventional IFAs were employed in the human sero-surveys and these relied on the MERS-CoV infected cell cultures. These cell cultures were the primary antigen sources for detecting the presence of human anti-MERS-CoV Nabs, IgM, and IgG in human samples (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">
        Corman et al., 2012b
       </xref>
       ). Further, it was reported that human monoclonal antibody m336 demonstrated significant neutralizing properties against MERS-CoV

       conditions (

       Recent studies revealed that there were few antiviral agents in the developmental stage. It was reported that the antiviral drug chlorpromazine demonstrated strong anti-MERS-CoV potential; however, the high cytotoxicity of the drug limiting the potential window for drug utilization. Similarly, another drug Toremifene showed moderate activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, however, the high cytotoxicity of this drug also narrowing its application as a therapeutic remedy against MERS-CoV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
        Cong et al., 2018
       </xref>
       ). Further, studies suggested that a nucleoside analog GS-5734 known as Remdesivir, which showed potential antiviral activity against human and zoonotic CoVs

       and the drug inhibited MERS-CoV at 50% effective concentration values (EC50) (

      Novel Therapeutic Approaches

      The conserved nature of the N protein was used to develop vaccines that can induce an adaptive immune response against these proteins. In a study by
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170">
       Zhao et al. (2016)
      </xref>
      reported that a vaccine candidate induced airway memory CD4+ T cell response against N-specific epitopes of MERS-CoV. In another study suggested that vaccination with recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) triggered greater T-cell response than the mice vaccinated with rRBD. The neutralizing activity was also observed in the sera (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">
       Jiaming et al., 2017
      </xref>
      ). Recent study revealed that the combination of fusion inhibitory peptide which targets the protein HR1 domain of MERS-CoV S2 and a neutralizing antibody specific for the S1 protein RBD showed synergistic therapeutic activities against MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">
       Wang et al., 2019
      </xref>
      ). Further, the researchers have developed novel neutralizing nanobodies (Nb) which specifically bind to the RBD of MERS-CoV S protein. The Nb was found to be interacted with the conserved domain of MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity and blocked binding of RBD to the receptor of MERS-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B167">
       Zhao et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Some immunodominant epitopes within the protein structure may contribute negatively to the neutralization activity of the vaccine. For example, a short region of RBD was able to induce higher titer of IgG when compared to other longer regions (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">
       Ma et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ). The negative effects of these epitopes can be surmounted by immunofocusing; mapping of the most neutralizing RBD fragment and eliminating unnecessary fragments. This can help in focusing the immune response to important epitopes (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">
       Ma et al., 2014
      </xref>
      ).
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">
       Pallesen et al. (2017)

      suggested that the structure-based design of S proteins improved their immunogenicity where the high titers of Nabs were observed against MERS-CoV. The major categories of vaccines developed and tested against various animal models are shown in

       Therapeutic Screening by Computational Biology
      </title>
      <p>
       The technological progression is reflected upon a series of genome wide molecular screening platforms and computational biology approaches that provided novel insights to prompt response against emerging viral diseases. The prototype of these approaches included the
       <italic>
        in vivo
       </italic>
       animal model, tissue culture model, human challenge model, and vaccine studies. These model systems are anxious by challenges, preferably yielding a spectra of the severity of the diseases like lethal versus sub-lethal in order to increase divergence for downstream data mining and modeling (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">
        McDermott et al., 2011

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">
        Law et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). A diversity of computational methodologies and network approach were used to detect the regulatory networks of various viral systems by
       <italic>
        de novo
       </italic>
       studies (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">
        Hou and Zhao, 2013
       </xref>
       ;
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">
        Mitchell et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, studies have shown that peptides can be utilized as highly potent signal transduction agents for various viral infections. It has been suggested that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can be used as potential therapeutic option against MERS-CoV infections (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">
        Mustafa et al., 2018
       </xref>
       ). Computational biology approach in combination with virology can be employed to design novel peptide based therapeutics against various strains of MERS-CoV with high efficacy. Recent studies have suggested that repurposing of existing and clinically approved anti-viral peptides can be used as promising lead molecules for the development of novel anti-MERS-CoV agents (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">
        Mustafa et al., 2018
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The RBD and S protein based vector vaccines are considered to be one of the efficient targets for designing MERS-CoV vaccine, as it comprised of multiple neutralizing epitopes which offer higher potential to prompt Nabs against the virus (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">
        Shi et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). The vast developments in computational biology have led to the new line of immunoinformatics databases and tools, which are other operative ways for vaccine development (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">
        Terry et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). The screening of dominant immunogens based on the availability of genome sequence data is crucial for designing novel vaccines, which is assisted by immunoinformatics (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">
        Firbas et al., 2006
       </xref>
       ). The epitope directed lead design was one of the critical steps involved in the lead identification by immunoinformatics approaches (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">
        Shi et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). MHC-I restrained CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) identification provides profound insight in designing novel antiviral agents (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">
        Terry et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, MERS-CoV infection continued to be fatal disease and has emerged as one of the epidemic concern. Irrespective of the various studies conducted to determine the distribution, the exact intermediates remain unidentified. There are various animal models available which provided profound insight in understanding the transmission and pathogenecity of the virus in human. The common pathogenesis mechanisms of the virus such as DPP4, PLpro, accessory proteins like p4a and membrane M protein provided significant insight for the screening of novel drug targets for vaccine development. The detailed understanding of the binding mechanism of various inhibitors toward the structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins of the virus probably provide profound insight for lead development. The integration of genome analysis, proteomics studies, immunoinformatics, and systems biology approaches on various animal models have made the recognition of new targets and lead molecules much easier in than the approaches available during earlier time. By considering MERS-CoV infections as one of the great public threats, there is high demand for undertaking the coronavirus research at the deeper molecular level to understand the mechanism of viral infection, development of advanced and rapid detection methods and futuristic therapeutic strategies to combat MERS-CoV infections.

       <p>
        Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019’s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2–14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49–56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54–73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17–29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks’ gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (

     Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA, nonsegmented, enveloped viruses, which cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe and fatal illness. The term coronavirus derives from the Latin word corona, which means crown or halo; that designation arises from the appearance of coronavirus virions viewed by electron microscopy, in which the virus particles display a crown-like fringe typically referred to as spikes (

     In the past 2 decades, 2 other coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness in humans have emerged: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a third coronavirus that can cause severe respiratory illness has been identified. In a short period of time, this novel coronavirus has caused more cases of illness than were reported for MERS and SARS combined.

Manifestations of SARS consist of fever, chills, headache, malaise, and myalgia. Diarrhea was seen in some patients. Pneumonia was nearly always seen in patients diagnosed with SARS, with mechanical ventilation being required in 10–20% of cases. Case fatality rate was estimated at 9–10% (

       Postpartum stays were reduced in length with a postpartum nurse home visit added. Postpartum patients were asked to observe a 10 day home quarantine. Health care workers were asked to observe a work quarantine in which they were asked to go directly from home to work and vice versa to minimize interaction in the community. Obstetric services considered to be nonessential such as routine ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis were suspended. Although the impact of these interventions was not evaluated, there may be some relevant lessons learned from these experiences during SARS that could help inform the approach to COVID-19.

       Nearly 2500 cases of MERS-CoV illness and more than 860 deaths have been reported with continuing reports into the present. The manifestations of MERS include severe respiratory illness characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some patients also have diarrhea. The case fatality rate is estimated to be 35–40%.
      </p>
      <p id="p0175">
       Patients who developed MERS were more likely to be older (median age is 50 years) with about two thirds of patients being male. Patients with MERS were also more likely to have an underlying illness. Some patients with MERS-CoV infection have been asymptomatic (identified through contact investigations).

       The mean incubation period is 5.2 days, with a range of 2–13 days. As with SARS, MERS is mainly spread person to person through close contact, with transmission in health care settings, and superspreading events have been observed. However, since 2016, the number of cases of MERS-CoV has been dramatically reduced after public health efforts to prevent MERS-CoV transmission were put into place.

        Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be similar to transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens; respiratory droplets are formed when an infected person coughs or sneezes and these droplets are inhaled by close contacts, generally within 6 feet. It is unclear whether infection can be transmitted from fomites. Fecal-oral transmission might be possible, given that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in stool specimens

        The basic reproduction number, R0 (the average number of people who will become infected from a single infected person in a population in which all persons are susceptible) is affected by factors such as the duration of infectivity, the transmissibility of the pathogen, and the number of susceptible contacts. Measles, which is highly infective, has an R0 of 12–18, while 2009 H1N1 influenza and SARS have an R0 of 1.2–1.6 and 2–5, respectively.

       In the midst of a rapidly evolving outbreak that could have significant effects on our public health and medical infrastructure, the unique needs of pregnant women should be included in preparedness and response plans. In previous outbreaks, clinicians have at times been reluctant to treat or vaccinate pregnant women because of concerns for fetal safety.

       It is critical that pregnant women not be denied potentially life-saving interventions in the context of a serious infectious disease threat unless there is a compelling reason to exclude them. As with all decisions regarding treatment during pregnancy, carefully weighing of the benefits of interventions for the mother and fetus with potential risks is necessary. As surveillance systems for cases of COVID-19 are established, it is essential that information on pregnancy status, as well as maternal and fetal outcomes, be collected and reported.

Among the 9 pregnancies, intrauterine fetal distress was noted in 6, 7 were cesarean deliveries, and 6 infants were born preterm.

        Travel recommendations have been instituted to limit exposure to persons in the United States. All persons, including pregnant women, should not travel to China. On Feb. 2, 2020, the US State Department upgraded their travel advisory to level 4, the highest level of travel advisory. Obstetric providers should obtain a detailed travel history for all patients and should specifically ask about travel in the past 14 days to areas experiencing widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently this is limited to China, but this situation is rapidly evolving and obstetricians should stay alert to the global situation by consulting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and following media coverage.

Infection control personnel and local/state health departments should be notified immediately; local/state health departments can help to arrange testing of relevant specimens (upper and lower respiratory specimens and serum are currently recommended; other specimens [stool and urine] may also be sent).

        Team-based management is recommended for pregnancies managed in a health care facility and should include a determination of the optimal clinical unit on which to provide care. Ability to provide surveillance for early detection of a worsening maternal course of illness, as well as an ability to monitor for evidence of obstetric complications (eg, preterm labor or fetal compromise), are needed.

        Changes in fetal heart rate pattern may be an early indicator of maternal respiratory deterioration. Based on experience with SARS and MERS, severe respiratory failure might occur in pregnant women, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation might not be sufficient to support adequate oxygenation. If that occurs, limited literature suggests a potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pregnancy; use should be considered only in centers that have experience with this technique.

        Given the current lack of information, it seems reasonable to assume that a newborn born to a mother with COVID-19 at delivery could possibly be infected, either in utero or perinatally, and thus should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to other newborns. Although the ideal setting for a healthy infant is within a healthy mother’s room, temporary separation of an ill mother and her infant, as was recommended during pandemic H1N1,

       Conclusions
      </title>
      <p id="p0330">
       The COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly increasing in the number of cases, deaths, and countries affected. Much is unknown about the virus and its effects, including its modes of transmission, the basic reproduction number, risk factors for illness, and case fatality rate. Although cases are primarily in China, it is highly likely that there will be additional global spread of the virus.
      </p>
      <p id="p0335">
       At the present time, limited data are available on pregnant women with COVID-19 on which to base recommendations for pregnancy-specific care; however, early reports and lessons from SARS, MERS, and other respiratory infections suggest that pregnant women could have a severe clinical course. Surveillance systems for cases of COVID-19 need to include information on pregnancy status as well as maternal and fetal outcomes.
      </p>
      <p id="p0340">
       It is important to be vigilant about the spread of the disease and be able to provide rapid implementation of outbreak control and management measures once the virus reaches a community. Standard interventions to manage any severe respiratory infection is the foundation of care for any pregnant woman with COVID-19 and should be implemented aggressively in a team-based care model.

        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in 2012. The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERSCoV involved 186 cases, including 38 fatalities. A total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders, and 44% of the 186 MERS cases were the patients who had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak. This outbreak provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge of MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in this paper, we review the literature on epidemiology, virology, clinical features, and prevention of MERS-CoV, which were acquired from the 2015 Korea outbreak of MERSCoV.

      INTRODUCTION
     </title>
     <p>
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in September 2012 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-kjim-2018-031">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. Since then, as of 31 January 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 2,143 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERSCoV infection, including at least 750 deaths, from 27 countries (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-kjim-2018-031">

      ) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-kjim-2018-031">

      </xref>
      ]. Most of MERS-CoV human infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia reported 1,783 cases, including 726 deaths (fatality rate, 40.7%) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-kjim-2018-031">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. A recent article summarized the current knowledge on the epidemiology, virology, human pathogenesis, clinical management, and prevention of MERS-CoV infection [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-kjim-2018-031">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. Another comprehensive review article on risk factors and determinants of transmission of MERS-CoV from human to human in the community and hospital settings has been published recently [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-kjim-2018-031">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Public Health England also published an extensive review of literature for clinical decision-making support for treatment of MERS-CoV patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-kjim-2018-031">

      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV is the largest outside the Arabian Peninsula and provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge about MERS-CoV infection. Since it has now been almost 3 years since the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, we reviewed the literature to summarize the lessons we have learned from the Korea outbreak.

      SEARCH STRATEGY
     </title>
     <p>
      PubMed databases were searched for studies on MERS cases during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea. The search terms used were combinations of ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome’ in all fields and ‘Korea’ in all fields. As of 31 January 2018, a total of 221 articles were retrieved, and 216 of them were written in English. The full texts of the English articles were reviewed and critically assessed.

       Summary of the Korea outbreak

      <p>
       The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV resulted in 186 cases including 38 fatalities [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-kjim-2018-031">

       </xref>
       ]. The index case was a returning traveler from the Middle East. The infection had spread within the hospital, and subsequently to other hospitals because of patient movement, resulting in nosocomial transmission at 16 clinics and hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months, with the government declaring a “virtual” end to the epidemic on July 6, 2015. In order to control the outbreak, the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days, and the economic loss was estimated at 9.311 trillion Korean won (8.5 billion US dollars) [

       The first case of MERS
      </title>
      <p>
       The first patient (index case) with MERS-CoV infection was a 68-year-old Korean man returning from the Middle East. He ran a commercial greenhouse business in Bahrain. He flew from Seoul to Bahrain on April 24, 2015, and traveled through the United Arab Emirate and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and came back to Seoul on May 4, 2015. During his 10-day business trip, he did not visit a camel farm or a hospital. He did not eat camel meat or any other camel products. He did not remember meeting any persons with respiratory symptoms [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       Seven days after returning home, on May 11, he developed fever and myalgia. He visited a local clinic on May 12, 14, and 15. His symptoms, however, did not improve and a new non-productive cough developed on 15th May. He visited Pyeongtaek St. Mary’s (PTSM) Hospital (65 km south from Seoul), a secondary hospital in Gyeonggi Province. His chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the upper zone of right lung, and he was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia on May 15. Ceftriaxone and amikacin were started, but his pneumonia progressed despite the antibiotic treatment. He was transferred to the Samsung Medical Center (SMC), a university-affiliated tertiary hospital in Seoul on May 17 [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-kjim-2018-031">

       ]. An infectious disease physician suspected MERS pneumonia and requested a laboratory test from the Korea Centers for Disease Control (CDC). MERS-CoV was confirmed on May 20.

       The first wave of the epidemic: outbreak at PTSM Hospital
      </title>
      <p>
       During his admission from May 15 to 17 at PTSM Hospital, the first patient was unknowingly spreading MERSCoV. Patients, visitors, and healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to MERS-CoV. Therefore, by May 20, when the Korea CDC noticed the importation of MERSCoV into the Republic of Korea, individuals staying on the same floor as the first case had already been exposed to MERS-CoV. As a result, a total of 36 MERS cases occurred at PTSM Hospital. Of them, 26 patients developed symptoms within 14 days after exposure, suggesting they were first-generation cases; the remaining 10 patients may be second-generation cases [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       The mode of transmission of MERS-CoV at PTSM Hospital remains uncertain. In addition to family members of the first patient, only one patient shared the same room (#8104) with him; all the other cases stayed in other rooms, which were located &gt; 2 m apart from room #8104. All patient rooms were equipped with an air ventilating system except for room #8104. A recent study using a multi-agent modeling framework suggested the transmission occurred via a long-range airborne route or via a combination of a long-range airborne route and direct contact transmission [

        18

During his 58-hour stay at the ER, he experienced vigorous coughing and watery diarrhea. On May 29, the Korea CDC found he was staying there. A laboratory test confirmed MERS-CoV infection and he was transferred to the Seoul National University Hospital, a government-designated isolation facility on May 30.

He developed symptoms on May 20 and was admitted to Daechung Hospital on May 22. As his pneumonia progressed despite the treatments, he was transferred to Geonyang Hospital on May 28. A total of 25 secondary cases (14 in Daechung Hospital and 11 in Geonyang Hospital) were detected. Although superspreader-2 caused the two hospital outbreaks, the median time of incubation (8.8 days vs. 4.6 days), secondary attack rates (4.7% vs. 3.0%), and case fatality rate (28.6% vs. 63.6%) were different between the two outbreaks. The high fatality rate was associated with pre-existing pneumonia or poor underlying pulmonary function [

       ]. The guideline recommended a triple combination regimen of type 1 interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir for 10 to 14 days. However, the guideline was mostly based on expert opinions and further study for the optimal antiviral treatment in MERS is warranted.

       Guidelines for infection control and prevention
      </title>
      <p>
       A comprehensive “MERS infection prevention and control guideline for healthcare facilities” was drafted by the guideline development committee with generous support from Korean Academic Societies [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-kjim-2018-031">
        78
       </xref>
       ]. The guideline included practical aspects of infection control and prevention based on the experience from the Korea outbreak, such as the composition of members for the MERS emergency committee, a space plan for an anteroom for donning and doffing, isolation of in-patients and HCWs in a hospital affected by an outbreak, and management of the deceased and autopsy [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       The hemodialysis unit may become an epicenter for MERS-CoV outbreak because hemodialysis patients must receive renal replacement therapy even during the outbreak, and the risk of exposure to MERS-CoV continues. During the Korea outbreak, a hemodialysis unit was found to have a MERS patient, and a total of 104 patients and 18 HCWs were exposed to MERS-CoV. With support from the Korean Society of Nephrology, the dialysis unit could continue to operate while the exposed patients were isolated in the unit. Fortunately, no further transmission occurred at the unit [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79-kjim-2018-031">
        79
       </xref>
       ]. After this successful experience, the Society published a clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis facilities dealing with MERS patients [

       The Korea outbreak was driven by the superspreaders who visited multiple healthcare facilities; thus, generating a large number of secondary cases. Limiting unnecessary contacts with patients with respiratory symptoms in healthcare settings, especially in emergency departments, is of critical importance [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-kjim-2018-031">

       MERS-CoV could survive for longer than 48 hours at 20°C and 40% of relative humidity, suggesting contact or fomite transmission might occur in healthcare settings [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-kjim-2018-031">
        81
       </xref>
       ]. MERS-CoV was detected by rRT-PCR in specimens taken from the medical equipment [

       ]. Of the 186 cases, 23% were infected by undocumented contact between cases (i.e., indirect transmission of MERS-CoV via environmental contact) [

        87
       </xref>
       ]. Therefore, fomites with possible MERS-CoV contamination should be sanitized, and a minimum room ventilation rate of six air changes per hour should be implemented to minimize recirculation of pathogen-bearing droplets. Meticulous environmental cleaning may be important for preventing transmission in healthcare settings.

       There was a case of a 39-year-old female nurse who was infected with MERS-CoV during a cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting 1 hour for a MERS patient who had pneumonia and hemoptysis [

       ]. Serological surveillance conducted after the MERS outbreak for asymptomatic infection among HCWs involved in the direct care of MERS patients showed that 0.3% (2/737) of them were MERS-CoV IgG positive by an indirect immunofluorescent assay. Among the HCWs who did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), seropositivity was 0.7% (2/294) compared with 0% (0/443) in HCWs with appropriate PPE use [

        89
       </xref>
       ]. Another serological survey also showed that none of the 285 HCWs were positive for MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G, although 38.2% (109/285) of the HCWs reported experiencing MERS-like symptoms while caring for the MERS patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90-kjim-2018-031">
        90

      <p>
       During the outbreak in SMC, all HCWs assigned to MERS patients were screened for MERS-CoV, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms. Of the 591 HCWs, three (0.5%) asymptomatic HCWs (two nurses and one physician) were found to be MERS-CoV (+), but they did not transmit the virus to others [

       However, the potential for transmission from asymptomatic rRT-PCR positive individuals is still unknown. Therefore, asymptomatic HCWs who are rRT-PCR-positive for MERS-CoV should be isolated and should not return to work until two consecutive respiratory-tract samples test negative on rRT-PCR [

      CONCLUSIONS
     </title>
     <p>
      The 2015 Korea outbreak was the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East. Researchers had a unique opportunity to compare the nature of MERS-CoV infection with the Middle East experience. The outbreak unveiled the weak points of infrastructure in our medical system, especially of preparedness for emerging global infectious diseases. Nosocomial transmission was one of the core features of MERS-CoV infection. The introspection for loose medical referral systems, overcrowding at the ER, a lack of expert resources and infection control infrastructure, and lack of organized preparedness for medical crises prompted the government to reform the healthcare system, and healthcare sectors to invest further in infectious diseases and infection control. Although the improvement is still ongoing, the speed and content are still currently insufficient. International cooperation to prepare for and defeat emerging infectious diseases should also be emphasized. Lessons we learned from the outbreak are summarized in

        The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus which first appeared in southern China at the end of 2002. In early 2003, through a single incident, it spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam. For busy clinicians in large public hospitals, the response to the virus was initially based on ensuring a high level of protection for staff. However, as the epidemic progressed and more information became available about the virus, procedures were rationalized and the virus is currently under control worldwide. There are, however, numerous unanswered questions concerning super-spreading events, the modes of transmission of the virus and, perhaps most importantly, the rapid detection of the virus early in the course of disease. These issues need to be addressed in case the virus becomes more widespread in the near future.

      Introduction
     </title>
     <p>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized coronavirus infection that emerged in southern China [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">
       1
      </xref>
      ] with subsequent global spread to 29 countries [

      </xref>
      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. In countries where local transmission has occurred, hospitals have been the major foci of infection especially in Singapore [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
       6
      </xref>
      ] and Canada [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. In February 2003, reports began emerging on ProMed Mail of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in the Guangdong province in southern China [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">
       8
      </xref>
      ]. It is now believed that the first cases of SARS occurred in the city of Foshan in the Guangdong province [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. However, throughout November until the late part of February, SARS was largely confined to the province of Guangdong.
     </p>
     <p>
      The global dissemination of SARS is believed to have begun on the ninth floor of Hotel M in Hong Kong, where a physician from Guangdong stayed for one night on 22 February 2003 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. At least 16 individuals who were staying on the ninth floor of the hotel were subsequently infected with SARS, although none of them reportedly had direct contact with the ill physician. The newly infected individuals traveled onward to their homes or next destinations in the USA, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Ireland sparking off epidemics of varying degrees of severity in each of those countries, mainly in hospitals but also in their respective communities. It is striking to realize that the entire global dissemination of this epidemic can probably be traced to this single event of one overnight hotel stay.

      Rapid scientific progress and an “outbreak” of publications
     </title>
     <p>
      It has almost become a cliché to report that the SARS epidemic, the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century, heralded an unprecedented collaboration between researchers across the globe. Within weeks of the first cases, electronic publications reviewed the clinical syndromes [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">
       4
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
       5
      </xref>
      ] as well as the characteristics of the virus and methods for its detection by the polymerase chain reaction [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">
       2
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. The genome of various strains of the virus were sequenced, which contributed tremendously to knowledge of its molecular epidemiology [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. There was an explosion of reports about the SARS coronavirus, with more than a thousand publications available on PubMed by the beginning of March 2004, the first anniversary of the global emergence of the virus. It is beyond the scope of this review to cover all of the virological and clinical information contained in these articles and I would refer the reader to the excellent review by Peiris et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. The present review focuses on the response to this emerging disease and its evolution in light of increasing information. Outstanding issues that remain to be resolved are also highlighted.

      Nosocomial spread and the proliferation of guidelines
     </title>
     <p>
      One of the first unusual aspects of this emerging infection was the recognition that healthcare workers (HCW) were uniquely susceptible to the then unknown etiologic agent. In Hong Kong, the first clue that a new infection had emerged was a cluster of ill HCWs. The same was noted in Vietnam and led to the World Health Organization (WHO) sending a team to Vietnam under the leadership of Dr Carlo Urbani, who later died from the virus he helped to define [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
       12
      </xref>
      ]. As soon as SARS was recognized as a nosocomial infection, guidelines were issued by various authorities including the WHO [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
       13
      </xref>
      ], the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">
       14
      </xref>
      ] and the Hong Kong Health Authority [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">
       15
      </xref>
      ], Health Canada [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">
       16
      </xref>
      ], and the Ministries of Health of Singapore [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">
       17
      </xref>
      ] and Malaysia [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
       18
      </xref>
      ] among others. It is important to recognize that in the beginning of the SARS outbreak there was no information about the agent responsible for the infection or its mode of transmission; hence, there was a tendency to “over-protect.” As the epidemic evolved, so did the guidelines, which are constantly being updated and might indeed be out of date by the time this report is read. All guidelines are published on the internet [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">

      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">

      Background: fears of pandemic influenza
     </title>
     <p>
      The physician from Guangdong who became the source of the global epidemic through his stay at Hotel M was admitted to a hospital in Hong Kong the day after his arrival in the city. He became progressively more ill and died 10 days later. It is striking that although he was critically ill and intubated on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, only one HCW who attended to him in the emergency department became ill [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">
       19
      </xref>
      ]. The reason for this is likely that Hong Kong hospitals had been on the alert for highly pathogenic avian influenza. In February, there had been a small cluster of cases of avian influenza in a Hong Kong family that had traveled to mainland China [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">
       20
      </xref>
      ]. A directive had gone out from the Hong Kong Department of Health on 21 February 2003 to maintain strict infection control with droplet precautions for all cases of “atypical” community-acquired pneumonia because of concerns that highly pathogenic avian influenza might be easily transmissible from person to person.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the Singaporean women who returned from Hotel M was indeed isolated as a possible case of avian influenza in one of Singapore’s large general hospitals, and no secondary cases resulted from her. Because of the concerns for possible avian influenza, or some unknown pathogen with an uncertain mode of transmission, most of the initial strategies devised for the prevention and control of SARS were directed against a highly contagious airborne pathogen.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 1997 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">
       21
      </xref>
      ], 18 previously healthy young people were infected and six died from highly pathogenic avian influenza in Hong Kong. This mortality rate (33%) is much higher than the normal mortality rate for influenza especially among young healthy individuals [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">
       22
      </xref>
      ]. In response to the outbreak, more than one million chickens were slaughtered and the disease was rapidly brought under control. Seroepidemiologic studies of HCWs done at the time [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
       23
      </xref>
      ] demonstrated the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing transmission and identified the risk associated with close personal contact in addition to the virus’s lack of efficient human-to-human transmission capability [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">
       21
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      Fears of a recurrence of a more virulent or easily transmissible form of avian influenza directed the initial efforts against SARS. However, SARS possessed an unusual quality in that it seemed to be transmitted in the healthcare setting far more efficiently than in households, where measles, varicella and other airborne viruses usually take rapid hold [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">
       24
      </xref>
      ]. This has yet to be explained completely, but it supports the argument that close contact is the major mode of transmission of the SARS virus.

      Fomite transmission and obsessions with hygiene
     </title>
     <p>
      Fomites have been a cause for concern with the SARS coronavirus since the initial global dissemination stemming from individuals in Hotel M who had no direct contact with the index case but had stayed in the same corridor and probably had occasion to touch elevator buttons or railings that might have been contaminated with the SARS virus. In the outbreak of SARS in the Amoy Gardens apartments in Hong Kong [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
       25
      </xref>
      ], more than 70 individuals who had no known direct contact were infected possibly through the aerosolisation of contaminated sewage. The implications of fomite transmission of SARS are considerable and would mandate a much greater degree of environmental cleaning than is currently practiced. However, there are many unanswered questions in this arena. For example, why did the individuals staying on the same hotel floor as the index case in Hotel M get infected but none of the staff? [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
       9
      </xref>
      ].

    <sec id="Sec6">
     <title>
      Coronaviruses and the implications for nosocomial spread of SARS
     </title>
     <p>
      SARS has been convincingly demonstrated to be caused by a coronavirus [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">
       26
      </xref>
      ]. Certain other characteristics have been ascertained from the previously known coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, including their ability to survive after drying on inanimate surfaces in the hospital environment as well as differences in the viability of the virus at different conditions of temperature and humidity [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">
       27
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">
       28
      </xref>
      ]. While the SARS coronavirus has a certain amount of homology with the other pathogenic human coronaviruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
       10
      </xref>
      ], too little is known about its behavior under different environmental and atmospheric conditions to make a definitive statement about the role of the environment in nosocomial transmission. There have been reports of the SARS coronavirus persisting for prolonged periods of up to 2 days on environmental surfaces [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">
       29
      </xref>
      ]. Survival in stool is reported to be even longer at up to 4 days in alkaline diarrheal stools. This would certainly help explain such circumstances as the Hotel M outbreak.
     </p>
     <p>
      The attack rates for SARS have generally not been high. In Singapore, for example, the index case for the national outbreak was nursed in a general ward by staff who were not wearing protective covering of any kind, and the attack rate was only 1/8 doctors, 9/30 nurses and 1/12 fellow patients in the same ward areas [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">
       30
      </xref>
      ]. Again, the distribution of infections suggests that close contact is the most important factor leading to the transmission of this pathogen in hospitals.

    <sec id="Sec7">
     <title>
      Personal protective equipment
     </title>
     <p>
      The widespread emphasis on PPE has been seen by some as placing an undue emphasis on HCW protection without adequately considering the protection of other at-risk individuals, such as other patients in the same area. The use of PPE is also not without its own adverse consequences [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">
       31
      </xref>
      ] as reactions to latex are common among HCWs, some with serious consequences. It should also be noted that the use of respirators has been associated with fatal adverse events [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">
       32
      </xref>
      ]. Costs are also an issue, and in resource-poor settings 12-ply cotton masks have been used, which have reportedly been effective in preventing the nosocomial transmission of the virus in at least one large public hospital [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">
       33
      </xref>
      ]. In a case-control study, Seto et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">
       34
      </xref>
      ] found that surgical masks were also effective in preventing transmission of SARS to HCWs, which is in line with our understanding of the epidemiology of the virus. In Singapore, one of the successes of our approach to the control of SARS was the widespread availability of full PPE for any staff member who requested it. This was even before the widespread dissemination of the virus led to the mandatory use of full PPE in all hospitals, and it provided staff the reassurance that their welfare was a high priority in the midst of an epidemic.
     </p>
     <p>
      There have been concerns that the use of N95 masks alone might not be adequate for preventing the nosocomial transmission of SARS since cases have occurred among “fully protected” HCWs [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">
       35
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">
       36
      </xref>
      ]; these cases possibly resulted from contact transmission. Recognition of the role of contact transmission has led to the inclusion of recommendations for the use of gloves and gowns in all guidelines [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
       13
      </xref>
      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
       18
      </xref>
      ]. While these garments have been shown to be effective in preventing the nosocomial transmission of other respiratory viruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">
       37
      </xref>
      ], few data are available for their efficacy regarding SARS.

      Airborne viruses and travel restrictions
     </title>
     <p>
      Travel restrictions were among the more controversial aspects of the SARS epidemic. The economies of most affected countries in East Asia were devastated by these travel advisories. While other pathogens have been documented as being transmitted on airplanes, most notably influenza [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">
       38
      </xref>
      ], the number of individuals infected with SARS during air travel was remarkably low. According to the WHO [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">
       39
      </xref>
      ], there have been 35 flights carrying symptomatic probable SARS patients and 31 of those flights did not result in a single secondary infection. Overall, 27 cases of secondary infection resulted from symptomatic individuals. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now known to have accounted for 22 of these 27 cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Olson et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">
       40
      </xref>
      ] reported that one flight with four symptomatic individuals with SARS was associated with an attack rate (for confirmed SARS) of zero while another flight with a single symptomatic individual was associated with an attack rate of 18%. The Singapore experience [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">
       41
      </xref>
      ] was that three flights with symptomatic SARS patients resulted in only one transmission. The overall attack rate for the flights into Singapore was thus less than 1% despite one symptomatic individual being a so-called “super-spreader” and another being critically ill at the time of the flight, requiring intubation soon after arrival. Interestingly, Olson et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">
       40
      </xref>
      ] point out that fully 45% of the fellow passengers who became infected with SARS had no direct contact, as defined by the WHO, with the index patient on their ill-fated flight. They do not offer any explanation for the differing attack rates, although a careful reader would realize that among the 22 individuals allegedly infected on the flight, ten were traveling together as part of a tour group. Also, the flight with the four symptomatic individuals was much shorter than the flight that was associated with widespread transmission. This is supported by ICU data from Canada [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">
       42
      </xref>
      ] that showed time of exposure to be a major risk factor. Overall, however, what these reports demonstrate is that a much more detailed analysis is required in order to truly understand the epidemiology of this unusual virus.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the peak of the SARS epidemic in China (1–28 April 2003), when the WHO had travel advisories and alerts in place, there were more than 27,000 visitors from China and Hong Kong [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">
       43

      ] who entered Singapore and not a single case of transmission was recorded from any of these individuals. In Taiwan, a strict 10-day quarantine [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">
       44
      </xref>
      ] was placed on all individuals returning from countries that were on the WHO list of SARS-affected countries. A total of 80,813 individuals were quarantined, among whom 11 had probable SARS and only one of whom had laboratory-confirmed SARS. Thus, the detection rate was 0.01% for probable SARS and 0.001% for laboratory-confirmed SARS. These figures have to be balanced against the costs and psychological impact of quarantine for more than 80,000 individuals who were perfectly well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thanks to excellent isolation and case finding with contact tracing, the number of people infected with SARS with each successive generation of the outbreak was progressively reaching extinction levels [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">
       45
      </xref>
      ] in the SARS-affected countries. With the re-emergence of SARS at the beginning of 2004, drastic travel restrictions have fortunately not been instituted to date since there is no evidence yet of widespread dissemination of the virus across international air routes by travelers. It could also be argued that since we now have much better knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus, travel restrictions might not be necessary the next time around.

      All of the guidelines agree it would be ideal if patients with SARS could be nursed in isolation rooms [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
       13
      </xref>
      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
       18
      </xref>
      ]. There are differences, however, in the recommendations for negative pressure with separate ventilation systems, and these perhaps reflect the differences in resources available for healthcare. One drawback of isolation rooms is that unless there are adequate nursing or medical resources, the degree of attention that the patient will receive in a single isolation room is obviously lower than in an open well-ventilated area. Patients isolated for infection control purposes are known to be at risk for adverse events in hospital [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">
       46
      </xref>
      ] and this again has to be balanced against the benefits in terms of reduced nosocomial transmission.
     </p>
     <p>
      While all of the available evidence points to droplet and contact transmission, there is a possibility that the virus might be aerosolized during such procedures as high-flow oxygen therapy or possibly via the use of extractor fans, which were blamed for the aerosolisation of contaminated sewage during the Amoy Gardens outbreak [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
       25
      </xref>
      ]. Therefore, N95 respirators or higher should be used. This is a cause for concern as in many countries, including Singapore, without adequate pre-prepared negative-pressure rooms, powerful extractor fans similar to the ones used in the bathrooms at the Amoy Gardens apartments are used to create a form of laminar uni-directional airflow. While these may serve to direct the flow of air away from areas of heavy traffic, it is possible that they might be hazardous by facilitating the aerosolisation of infectious droplets.

      Isolation and structural issues

      In Singapore [

      ] and Canada [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">
       48
      </xref>
      ], transmission of the SARS virus has been noted in crowded emergency rooms where patients routinely wait for hours for a hospital bed. In Singapore, SARS was documented as being transmitted to a patient’s visitor who was waiting in a corridor during the patient’s radiological procedure [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">
       49
      </xref>
      ], again a common occurrence in many healthcare settings. In our own hospital, the National University Hospital, the largest cluster of SARS cases occurred in one of our eight-bed wards [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">
       47
      </xref>
      ] where patients are deliberately placed eight to a cubicle in order to support the philosophy of healthcare financing in Singapore. The SARS outbreak has clearly been a wake-up call for health authorities worldwide [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">
       50
      </xref>
      ] as they try to adjust health systems primarily designed to minimize costs into systems designed to protect staff and patients. The isolation and segregation of patients with suspect and probable SARS has been credited with markedly reducing the transmission of the virus [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">
       45
      </xref>
      ]. Lipsitch et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">
       45
      </xref>
      ] reported a reduction in the time to isolation of patients with SARS as the epidemic progressed with a corresponding decline in the number of secondary cases as knowledge of the virus increased.

      Super-spreaders or super-spreading events?
     </title>
     <p>
      The majority of individuals with SARS have not transmitted the virus to anyone [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">
       49
      </xref>
      ]. While it is tempting to ascribe this to infection control measures, many of these individuals were infected and hospitalized long before the institution of infection control methods. This has given rise to the concept of “super-spreaders.” It is known that the presence of common viral upper respiratory tract infections can turn some HCWs into so-called “cloud HCWs” [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">
       51
      </xref>
      ]. These individuals have been linked with the airborne dispersal of agents that are normally only spread through contact, such as group A streptococci or
      <italic>
       Staphylococcus aureus
      </italic>
      . The hypothesis is that the presence of upper respiratory tract infections transforms these individuals into efficient transmitters of pathogens through increased coughing, sneezing or nose rubbing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternatively, airborne dispersal could result from the use of various respiratory therapies. The index patient for the Singapore epidemic was not isolated, and 22 HCWs, visitors and fellow patients were infected [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. The second generation of cases associated with this cluster, before the institution of infection control practices or strict isolation, included only 13 cases. The situation in Canada was similar, with cases in the second generation occurring pre-isolation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. It is quite clear, however, that non-isolated patients are hazardous to staff, visitors and other patients. Single non-isolated patients have led to well-documented outbreaks in hospitals in Singapore [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">
       49
      </xref>
      ], Taiwan [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">
       52
      </xref>
      ], Canada [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">
       53
      </xref>
      ] and Hong Kong [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">
       54
      </xref>
      ]. The phenomenon of “super-spreaders” has been invoked to explain why so few transmissions resulted from the majority of non-isolated individuals while a few rare cases were associated with the vast majority of transmissions [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">
       49
      </xref>
      ]. The jury is still out as to whether these are indeed individuals who are for some reason more able to transmit infection or whether events, such as the use of high-flow oxygen therapy, are more responsible for what are probably more accurately described as “super-spreading events.” Until we have more virologic information, we have to assume that all individuals with SARS are “super-spreaders” until proven otherwise and we have to take all the necessary precautions.

      Whom to isolate?
     </title>
     <p>
      Again, because of the concern that an undiagnosed patient might turn out to be a “super-spreader,” the threshold to isolation has become progressively lower. Initially, hospitals and clinics were using the WHO case definitions of suspect and probable SARS cases to determine which cases to isolate. As we, and others, have pointed out, atypical presentations [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">
       55
      </xref>
      ] are the Achilles heel of such a strategy and these have been associated with significant nosocomial transmission. In a very important report from a SARS screening clinic, Rainer et al. [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">
       56
      </xref>
      ] pointed out that the WHO criteria, which were actually designed for epidemiologic purposes, while relatively specific, have a sensitivity of only about 25% in predicting which individuals will turn out to have SARS. The implications are that a large number of individuals will need to be isolated and monitored very closely until their clinical course becomes evident. In practice in Singapore, this resulted in the conversion of large numbers of hospital wards to isolation facilities, cancellation of elective surgeries and an overall paralysis of the healthcare system. We used a regime of 4-hourly temperature monitoring without any use at all of antipyretics together with daily serial chest radiographs and blood counts and comprehensive chemistry work ups. With this regime, we found a sensitivity of 28%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 11% and negative predictive value of 99% for the WHO criteria at patient presentation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">
       57
      </xref>
      ]. It is clear that an accurate rapid diagnostic test is urgently needed to allow us to filter out individuals who are at low risk of SARS or, better still, at lower risk of transmitting the virus should they not be isolated. Current diagnostic tests [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">
       58
      </xref>
      ], which are based on either molecular methods or serological diagnosis, are severely limited not predominantly by sensitivity or specificity but by the fact that they take awhile to become positive, during which time widespread dissemination of the virus could have occurred from a single non-isolated “super-spreader.”

      Fever screening
     </title>
     <p>
      Fever screening is widely practiced as a SARS-prevention measure. There was even a period when the WHO called for fever screening at airports to prevent the global spread of SARS. Unfortunately, fever is a non-specific and insensitive screening tool for SARS [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">
       56
      </xref>
      ]. Atypical presentations of SARS without fever have been reported especially in older and immunocompromised patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">
       59
      </xref>
      ]. One case is particularly illustrative [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">
       47
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      A 63-year-old man cleared a fever triage area in an emergency room as he was afebrile; he was then admitted to a general ward (not a “fever ward”) as a case of heart failure, and he remained afebrile until he developed a low-grade temperature after being transferred to the medical intensive care unit for progressive shortness of breath. Two other patients, one visitor and one nurse who had been in the same emergency department area as this patient were infected with SARS. The visitor, a previously healthy 28-year-old woman, died and her husband and son were subsequently infected. In the brief period the index patient was in the general ward, two other patients and the entire shift of nurses working in the ward at the time, who were only wearing N95 masks, were infected. By the time the patient became febrile in the intensive care unit, staff were wearing full PPE and no further infections resulted. Thus, a single patient who “passed” two strict fever screens managed to be the source of at least nine infections in less than 24 h. This patient was critically ill and died 3 days later; thus, he may have had a very high viral load. This case illustrates the limitations of “cookbook screening” by using fever protocols without paying attention to a careful clinical history and physical examination. In this case, an alert cardiology team who re-did the patient’s history and examination and performed a bedside echocardiograph to prove that he was suffering from pneumonia not heart failure made the diagnosis.

      Inter-hospital transfer of patients or viruses

      During the SARS outbreak, the inter-hospital transfer of patients in Canada [

       6

      ] was a very efficient means of dissemination of the SARS virus. In Singapore, on 22 March, the decision was made to close one hospital to new admissions and to concentrate all SARS patients there [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. This unfortunately led to patients recently discharged from this hospital being shunted to other hospitals and starting off epidemics there. Now, in Singapore, once a cluster of cases with even a low degree of suspicion is identified, the unit is “locked down” with no admissions, transfers or discharges in order to prevent a recurrence of the former situation. This strategy was also used successfully in Vietnam to contain the SARS virus, which led to Vietnam being the first country to be declared free of local transmission of SARS [

      Conclusion and research questions
     </title>
     <p>
      While we have learned a tremendous amount in the brief period since SARS first emerged in November 2002, there are still a number of unresolved issues for practicing clinicians. The cases of SARS in early 2004 have quashed hopes that the virus was “put back in the box,” and in the formerly affected countries many clinicians are deeply worried about dealing with a devastating resurgence of the virus. I have a personal “wish list” of questions that I would like answered before too long. These include: what are the conditions required for the airborne transmission of the SARS coronavirus? When can we be sure that transmission does not occur? When can we get a good rapid diagnostic test that is positive early in the course of the illness? What makes a super-spreading event? Is quarantine really necessary? I can only hope that the answers to these and numerous other questions raised by infection control practitioners, hospital epidemiologists, infectious disease clinicians and researchers can be answered before we face the next SARS outbreak or something worse! Even as this is being written, avian influenza rampages across East Asia affecting primarily birds, but also claiming the lives of more than 20 individuals. If this becomes a pandemic form of influenza, SARS will pale in comparison.

         In 2015, the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea. We summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the first Korean case of MERS-CoV and analyzed whole-genome sequences of MERS-CoV derived from the patient.

         Case presentation

        <p id="Par2">
         A 68-year-old man developed fever and myalgia 7 days after returning to Korea, following a 10-day trip to the Middle East. Before diagnosis, he visited 4 hospitals, potentially resulting in secondary transmission to 28 patients. On admission to the National Medical Center (day 9, post-onset of clinical illness), he presented with drowsiness, hypoxia, and multiple patchy infiltrations on the chest radiograph. He was intubated (day 12) because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and INF-α2a and ribavirin treatment was commenced. The treatment course was prolonged by superimposed ventilator associated pneumonia. MERS-CoV PCR results converted to negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged (day 137), following rehabilitation therapy. The complete genome sequence obtained from a sputum sample (taken on day 11) showed the highest sequence similarity (99.59%) with the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015.

        <p id="Par3">
         The first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and was associated with a severe clinical course. The patient made a successful recovery after early treatment with antiviral agents and adequate supportive care. This first case in South Korea became a super-spreader because of improper infection control measures, rather than variations of the virus.

     <p id="Par9">
      The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in May 2015: the first confirmed case of a patient who recently visited endemic areas. Over the following 2 months, 186 cases were confirmed, including 36 deaths [

      ].
     </p>
     <p id="Par10">
      Of 24 imported cases of MERS in countries outside the Middle East, only 4 cases involved at least one secondary transmission event and 4 transmitted cases, excluding South Korea [

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">

      ]. It is important to evaluate the cause of this significant outbreak in South Korea, and whether the clinical features of the first patient were different from those in patients in other countries.
     </p>
     <p id="Par11">
      The National Medical Center (NMC), Seoul, Korea, was designated as the primary MERS response center (MERS Countermeasure Headquarters) and treated patients with MERS, including the first patient. We report the clinical course and laboratory findings of the first case of MERS-CoV in South Korea to understand the unexpected spread of the outbreak. Unlike previous papers focused on epidemiology [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">

      ], we focused on detailed clinical progress and genetic analysis that have not been previously published.

       RNA samples extracted from a sputum sample from the index patient on day 11 (May 22, 2015) were reverse transcribed to cDNA followed by PCR with MERS-CoV-specific primer pairs with overlaps. Amplicons were pooled for library preparation, and next generation sequencing was performed using the MiSeq sequencing system. The genomic sequences of the virus were assembled using CLC genomic workbench 8.0.1, and the obtained 29,995-bp whole genome sequence was registered in GenBank as MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/001_05_2015 (accession no. KT326819).

       Phylogenetic construction and ORF comparison
      </title>
      <p id="Par14">
       All previously published 93 MERS-CoV complete genome sequences and the Korean index case were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using RAxML v8.1.21 (1000 bootstrap replicates), with the GTR model of nucleotide substitution and γ-distributed rates among sites. From the phylogenetic tree, 8 representative sequences, including each lineage and year, were selected for further analysis. The amino acid sequence identity of 10 open reading frames (ORF) between index sequence and 8 reference sequences of MERS-CoV was determined using BLAST. Each 10 ORF sequence was aligned using the MUSCLE program and all amino acid changes for each ORF sequences were analyzed. A root-to-tip regression analysis was performed with Path-O-Gen software to investigate the temporal signal in the data (

       ). Phylogeny without a molecular clock was inferred from the maximum likelihood method implemented in RAxML, and then analyzed in Path-O-Gen with the dated tips.

      <p id="Par15">
       A 68-year-old Korean man developed fever and myalgia on May 11, 2015 (D0) in Korea. He visited a local clinic (A) in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province on D1, 3 and 4. Laboratory results on D3 were within normal ranges, except for mild lymphopenia (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">

       ). He was prescribed ribostamycin, acetaminophen, afloqualone, rebamipide, and streptokinase; however, the fever and myalgia persisted. On May 15 (D4), he developed a nonproductive cough. He was hospitalized in a private general hospital (B) in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province between 15 and 17 May. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the chest (D4) showed a diffuse ground-glass opacity and consolidation in the central portion of the right upper lobe of the lung (Fig.

       The patient was a businessman living in South Korea and occasionally visiting the Middle East on business. On April 24, 2015, he flew from South Korea to Bahrain, via Doha, Qatar. He stayed in Bahrain until May 3, 2015, except for two single-day business trips to the United Arab Emirates and to Saudi Arabia. He runs a business in Bahrain, providing greenhouse systems for professional growers. During his stay he was the sole occupier of a second floor apartment in a five-story building, with two native households residing on each floor. The building was a 15-min drive from the worksite. There was no elevator in the building and he never met the neighbors. He went to work in his own car and did not use public transportation. In Bahrain, he supervised business in the field, attended meetings, and met many buyers from nearby countries. He did not encounter any ill persons and there were no camels or bats in proximity of the greenhouse.

       The genome of the index case (KT326819) consisted of 29,995 nucleotides with a ploy(A) tail and 10 ORFs were predicted. The nucleotide sequence identity by pairwise comparisons using the 93 complete genome sequences from the NCBI and the public site was in the range of 97.75–99.59%. The MERS-CoV of the index case produced the best similarity (99.59%) with the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015 (Riyadh_KKUH_0780_20150225) included in lineage 5. In amino acid sequences comparisons, Riyadh_KKUH_0780_ 20150225 also show high identities through 10 ORFs (99.1–100.0%) (Table

When compared with 8 representative strains, most ORFs showed high identities (over 99.0%) and the E gene was identical to each strain. ORF3 was the most variable gene with identities of 96.1–100.0%. The S gene encoding the spike protein which interacts with the host receptor was identical, ranging from 99.8 to 99.9%.

       To identify the genetic features separated from the 2015 Riyadh strains, we analyzed amino acid changes between the Korean index genome and 8 isolates in representative lineage. We found 104 amino acid alteration sites. Compared to the EMC/2012 strain, the Korean index case showed 42 amino acid differences, whereas the closest Riyadh_KKUH_0780_20150225 strain showed 13 amino acid inconsistencies (Fig.

When we examined the 93 reference whole genomes, we found previously unreported amino acid changing alteration sites, in the ORF1ab (D977G, G6896S) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S gene (I529T). In addition to these nonsynonymous alterations, 8 unique synonymous alteration sites were identified in the ORF1ab (T7154, C9956T, C10994T, T11927C, C18790A), S (T24632C, C24722T) and ORF3 (C25714T) gene.

       We showed that genomic change occurs in the MERS-CoV Korean strains. We further examined whether these evolution rates exhibit spatial and temporal patterns during outbreaks. We plotted root-to-tip distances of the isolates against geographic location and isolation time (Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">
        6
       </xref>
       ). The root-to-tip method measures rates over the entire history of a lineage, and is suitable for comparing evolution rates to long-term sequence traits. We observed a strong and statistically significant phylogeographic correlation between mutation rate and isolation date, recognizing the tendency that the root-to-tip distances through time were increased. For example, the isolates in the 2013–2014 year of MERS-CoV displaying shorter root-to-tip distances were in closer proximity to EMC/2012 than the 2015 Korean and Thailand isolates. The regression line showing this tendency was marked as a dotted line and the previously reported sequences were closely fitted to line (R2 = 0.86). The y values of the 2015 Korean strains and closest Riyadh strains of KSA were slightly higher than the regression line, meaning that these strains had changed faster than the average strains. However, the distances from the regression line were on the range of other past MERS-CoV strains. This suggested that the rate of evolution or adaptation of the Korean strains to the host were not the considerably different and MERS-CoV had undergone gradual change. The Korean MERS-CoVs showed some genetic differences compared to previous strains. To explain the meaning of each nucleotide change and the influence on viral transmissibility or disease severity, further studies are required.

      Like previous MERS outbreaks, the MERS-CoV infection in Korea was hospital acquired transmission. However, the overwhelming extent arouse suspicion that there might be a distant feature at the molecular, genetical, clinical, and epidemiological level. It is postulated that the first case in South Korea transmitted MERS-CoV to 28 secondary cases [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">

      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">

      </xref>
      ]. There have been no reports of such a significant outbreak in countries outside the Middle East experiencing importation of MERS-CoV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. In the 2013 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, one patient transmitted MERS-CoV to seven other persons, raising concerns about a potential super-spreader [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. In the Korean outbreak, 5 patients, including the first case, were reported to be super-spreaders, transmitting the virus to 153 out of 186 MERS patients [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. What makes certain hosts become super-spreaders remains unclear. Host, pathogen, and environmental factors may be implicated in the MERS outbreak [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. In the first case, prolonged duration of exposure before diagnosis and proper isolation and frequent inter-hospital transfer may have contributed to the super-spreading event. Higher pathogen shedding may also have contributed to the spread because the patient developed severe pneumonia and the severe cough and high viral load could facilitate infection transmission. Additionally, nosocomial transmission by healthcare workers or environmental factors, such as inadequate ventilation, could be responsible. Kim, et al. reported that the MERS-CoV was confirmed by RT-PCR of viral cultures of air samples and environmental surface swabs from hospital B, suggesting the possibility of contact and airborne transmission [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. In line with previous results, MERS-CoV contamination of environmental surfaces [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
       12
      </xref>
      ] and virus persistence in the air surrounding the infected camels or humans, persisted for at least 24 h [

      The possibility of increased strain virulence was raised in the Korean outbreak; however, there was no evidence of viral mutation capable of modifying the mode of transmission or virulence until now [

      ]. Firstly, the identified Korean strains showed no specific evidence of viral adaptation to change infectivity or transmissibility. The 2015 Riyadh strains, which are a recombinant from the EMC_2012 strain and Jeddah-1_2013, were suggested as the ancestor of Korean strains [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">

      ]. Several variation sites, particularly in spike proteins, have been identified but these variations including I529T, firstly found in Korean index patient, showed that the affinity for the host receptor was reduced, resulting in reduced entry efficiency [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">
       16

However, a phylogenetic tree strongly suggested that the MERS-CoV was transmitted from the circulating Riyadh strains.

      Many patients were infected with MERS-CoV in hospitals A, B, and C, although no confirmed secondary cases of infection occurred in hospital D while the index patient remained in ED for 2 days, for 4 and 5 h, respectively, before placement into isolation [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">
       19
      </xref>
      ]. This difference may be explained by various factors, such as patient behavior and symptoms or degree of contact exposure. Many secondary cases occurred in hospital D, at a later stage; however, these resulted from transmission by another patient [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">
       19
      </xref>
      ].

      The patient manifested the most prevalent MERS symptoms: fever (98%), chills (87%), and cough (72–83%) but no gastrointestinal tract symptoms, generally observed in over 20% of MERS patients. Laboratory data were comparable to those of other MERS patients, including lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and inflammatory markers. Transient progression of thrombocytopenia from D12 appeared to be caused by interferon and ribavirin [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">
       20

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">

      </xref>
      ]. Pneumonia progressed rapidly and ventilator support was required. Studies have shown that the clinical features of MERS are similar to those of SARS; however, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly. Specifically, the fatality rate of MERS is much higher and is likely to be associated with older age and comorbidities [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">

      </xref>
      ].

     <p id="Par38">
      In the absence of approved specific therapy, clinical management of MERS largely depends on supportive care and prevention of complications. Our patient also received supportive care, such as O

      therapy, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support, and antimicrobial therapy. Although there is no proven effective antiviral therapy against MERS-CoV, in vitro data suggest that combined use of interferon and ribavirin reduces disease severity in a rhesus macaque model of MERS [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
       23
      </xref>
      ]. In a retrospective study of 20 patients with MERS, ribavirin and interferon-α2a improved 14-day and 28-day survival by 70 and 28%, respectively, compared to an untreated group [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">
       24
      </xref>
      ]. However, another study found that there were no survivors among 5 patients with MERS receiving a combination therapy of interferon-α2b and ribavirin. The median time from admission to therapy for these patients was 19 (range, 10–22) days, suggesting that late administration of antiviral therapy may have contributed to the poor outcome [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
       25
      </xref>
      ]. Therefore, timing antiviral therapy may be critical. In our patient, antiviral therapy was initiated on admission.

      Duration of treatment of the index case was more prolonged because of the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant

      Despite the severe clinical course, our patient made a full recovery. Follow-up pulmonary function tests normal, except for a slightly decreased DLCO. Studies examining lung function outcome and longer-term consequences and sequels of MERS survivors have not been reported until recently; therefore, further follow-up is needed.

      Conclusions
     </title>
     <p id="Par41">
      In summary, the first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and a severe clinical course, although the patient made a successful recovery. Specialized intensive care may be critical in the treatment of MERS, because patients often progress to ARDS requiring ventilatory support. Unlike MERS cases imported from other countries, our first case became a super-spreader because of the social practices in Korea, rather than variations of the virus. The Korean health care system is vulnerable to hospital-acquired infection and proper infection control measures are needed to prevent MERS-CoV transmission in the healthcare setting.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.

      . These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope

      . Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization. Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins. The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16. The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N). A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D)

      . Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

      . Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity. The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world. Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, driving force and restriction factors of species jumping. This might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers. In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs. Particularly, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host. We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity. The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.

      History of HCoV discovery

     <p>
      Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s. Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">

       </xref>
       . Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">

       Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest. First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs. Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63). On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms. On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower. Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV. On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs. On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, same as the other HCoVs
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">
        41
       </xref>
       , SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples. Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies. It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs. Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.

      Animal origins of HCoVs
     </title>
     <p>
      All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans. From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs. In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics. HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated. For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors. In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans. If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects. These viruses do not need an animal reservoir. In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained. They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts. SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs. It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being. However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs. An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence. The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host. Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term. In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus. In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic. This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection. An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host. On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity. In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">

In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs. The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established. Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology. It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution. A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species. As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs

      Interspecies transmission of HCoVs
     </title>
     <p>
      Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history. When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">
       68
      </xref>
      . The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear. Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found. Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV. Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly. First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche. Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas. Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">
       65
      </xref>
      . Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals. Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans. In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">

      . It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly. Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV

       Host determinants of transmission

      <p>
       MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans. The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">

       </xref>
       . It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission. Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'. On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades. It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host. MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals. Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different. Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins. They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV. Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies. First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2. Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining. Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced. Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat. It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted. Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins. The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.

       Viral determinants of transmission

       Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers

        70
       </xref>
       . First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication. In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10
       <sup>
        -4

       , depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts. CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability. Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">
        70
       </xref>
       . Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials. Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts. In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">
        71
       </xref>
       . Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">
        72
       </xref>
       , the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans. Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels. Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly. Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate. This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome. Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism. In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription. Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs. Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9

       Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
      </title>
      <p>
       Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission. Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events

       . Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">
        74
       </xref>
       . Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response. In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318

       amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">
        75
       </xref>
       . The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus. In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor. Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor. In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans

      </p>
      <p>
       It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
        8
       </xref>
       . A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered

        5
       </xref>
       . Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">
        76
       </xref>
       . It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">
        77
       </xref>
       . There exist many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43. They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors. The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission. HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission. In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized. An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.

       Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero

      <p>
       The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs. In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs. In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process

       </xref>
       . For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes. Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">
        48
       </xref>
       . A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic. This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">
        78
       </xref>
       . Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">
        72

       . Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">
        79
       </xref>
       . Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system. An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">
        80
       </xref>
       . While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">
        81
       </xref>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts. Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">
        82
       </xref>
       . It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically. For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">
        83
       </xref>
       . Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">
        84
       </xref>
       . Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">
        85
       </xref>
       , thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host. More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">
        82
       </xref>
       . Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels. They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response. Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection. The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage. In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication. The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. The interferon response is particularly strong in bats. Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">
        86

       . By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.

       The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose. Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2. Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified. Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2. Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.

      Conclusions
     </title>
     <p>
      CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission. Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts. Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic. By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2. However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time. These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people. They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa. It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures. As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild. Particularly, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse. There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future. The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals. With the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place. In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time. They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover. Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them. Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks. To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing. First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche. Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined. Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified. Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted. Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future. Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

        Blue, green, purple, red, orange, grey, brown arrows represent the transmission of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 from their natural hosts (bats or rodents) to the intermediate hosts (camelids, civets, dromedary camels, pangolins or bovines), and eventually to the human population. No concrete evidence exists on the intermediated host(s) of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, which was shown as a question mark (?).

        The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity, genomics and cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses, especially those from bats, the second most speciose order of mammals. Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of
        <italic>
         Rousettus leschenaulti
        </italic>
        bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3’-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution.

        Author Summary
       </title>
       <p>
        Recombination is commonly reported in coronaviruses, and is an important mechanism by which these viruses generate genetic diversity. To date, however, most such recombination events involve homologous sequences among related viruses. We discovered a novel bat coronavirus that possesses a divergent but functional p10 gene that likely originated from, or shared the ancestry with, an ancestral non-enveloped orthoreovirus, thereby representing the outcome of heterologous recombination. We report herein a fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein encoded in an enveloped virus that arose through a putative inter-family recombination between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus. These findings shed important new light on the mechanisms of viral evolution and particularly the importance and scope of heterologous recombination.

      Introduction

      Coronaviruses are large, enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense, non-segmented RNA genomes [

      are now classified into four genera:

      Coronaviruses employ a unique mechanism of viral genome replication and RNA synthesis, resulting in high frequencies of both mutation and recombination [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref004">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. Recombination appears to be particularly important in coronavirus evolution [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref005">
       5
      </xref>
      ], with a number of hotspots interspersed throughout the viral genome [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref006">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. Recombination events at 3’-end of the genome might impact the replication ability of coronaviruses since there are a number of regulatory sequences and accessory genes in this region [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref005">
       5
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      As coronaviruses were previously known to cause only mild respiratory illnesses in humans they were not a major concern of the public health community. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref007">
       7
      </xref>

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref009">

      ] and its high infectivity and fatality generated considerable interest in the biodiversity, genomics, evolution, natural hosts and potential inter-species transmission of coronaviruses [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref010">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. To date, at least 90 types of coronavirus have been isolated or genome-identified from humans and a wide variety of animals, including domestic animals, wild birds and bats. Bats are particularly notable in this respect because they are known to harbor a diverse range of pathogens, and are known to be the reservoir hosts of both human coronavirus 229E [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref011">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref012">
       12
      </xref>
      ], and are closely related to MERS-CoV [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref014">

      ]. As a consequence bats have been prioritized for the surveillance of emerging zoonotic diseases [

      In the present study we report a novel coronavirus discovered from bat samples in China that has been tentatively named Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 may have arisen from a recombination event between an ancestral coronavirus and a fusogenic orthoreovirus.

       bats sampled in Yunnan province China were screened for the presence of coronavirus RNA. Of these, 47 (40%) samples were found to be coronavirus positive. The PCR products were sequenced and BLAST searches revealed the sequences to be authentic coronavirus genes, with the strongest similarity to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) [

       (group D). However, our attempts to isolate the virus from samples using a number of cell lines, including Vero E6, BHK-21, MDCK, A549, HEp-2, CaCo-2 and a bat cell line from Myotis kidney, were unsuccessful. The cell lines were inoculated with positive samples and three blind passages were performed for each sample. No cytopathic effect was observed in any passage, and there was an absence of viral replication from the culture supernatant and cell pellet of each passage.

       The viral genomic sequences present in two coronavirus positive samples (numbers 346 and 356) were determined with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Analysis using a partial (816-bp fragment) sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene indicated that the newly identified virus was likely to be a novel coronavirus according to previously proposed criteria [

       ]. Therefore, this virus was tentatively designated as Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1). Gaps within the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 were closed, and the complete genome sequence confirmed, using Sanger sequencing. Finally, the 5’- and 3’-ends of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome were obtained using 5’ and 3’ RACE (

         Genome organization of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. Nonstructural genes and putative mature nonstructural proteins, structural genes, and 5’- and 3’-UTR are illustrated with yellow, dark blue and light blue colors, respectively. The remarkable p10 gene is shown in red. The potential origin of the p10 gene is indicated by a dotted arrow and a question mark. The leader sequence and leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) are directly shown with nucleobases. The bat,

The schematic virion of orthoreovirus and the segment S1 of the genome that it contains are used to demonstrate the possible origin of the p10 gene.

       Excluding the polyadenylated tail at the 3’-terminus, the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was 30,129 nt in length with a G/C content of 45.4%. Comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains [

        18

       ] with 66.6% - 67.4% nucleotide identities. Similarly, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 displayed equivalent genomic characteristics to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 except for an inserted gene at 3’ end (discussed in detail in the next section). The major open reading frames (ORFs) had the identical order, namely 5’- replicase ORF1ab—spike (S)—NS3—envelope (E)—membrane (M)—nucleocapsid (N) followed by the accessory genes encoding nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g001">

       and
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005883.t001">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ), although the N gene was truncated. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the ORF1ab, S, NS3, E, M and N proteins of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 shared higher identities with Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains than those of other betacoronaviruses (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005883.t001">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ). Also of note was that the 3’-end of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome, just downstream of N gene, possessed a much more complicated structure than those of other members in the genus. Clearly, there were four NSP-encoding ORFs. According to the convention, the second-to-fourth ORFs were temporarily named NS7a, NS7b and NS7c, respectively, since they shared 29% - 53% amino acid identities with the accessory genes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains and other related bat coronaviruses (

        S1 Table
       </xref>
       ). Perhaps the most striking feature of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was the presence of a small intact ORF with 276 bases embedded between the N and NS7a genes. Although this ORF that had no homology to any known coronavirus, the encoded protein exhibited 30% - 54.9% amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first ORF of segment S1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses [

       . Therefore, this ORF was provisionally marked as p10 according to the molar weight of protein that it encodes (

          The NS7c protein of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 shares 30% - 53% amino acid identity (90% - 99% coverage) with the NS7b protein of Bat coronavirus HKU9-1, HKU9-2, HKU9-3, HKU9-4, HKU9-10-1 and HKU9-10-2.

       The putative leader and body transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, and their genomic localizations, were predicted in accordance with consensus core sequences of the TRSs of betacoronaviruses (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005883.t001">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ). The TRS core sequence, 5’-ACGAAC-3’, was consistent with those of SARS-CoV, Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and other betacoronaviruses. From the location of leader TRS, the leader sequence of the genome was then identified, which spanned genome positions 1 (G) to 78 (C) (

       ). Notably, in the putative TRS of the p10 gene, there was one nucleobase difference with the consensus core sequence (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005883.t001">

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The putative mature nonstructural proteins (NSPs) in the ORF1ab encoding the replicase were calculated based on the cleavage and recognition pattern of the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and papain-like proteinase (PLpro). Comprehensive information on the size and genomic locations of nsp1 to nsp16 and the putative cleavage sites of proteinases is presented in
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005883.t002">
        Table 2
       </xref>
       . Previous studies indicated that the P1 position of 3CLpro specific cleavage site is exclusively occupied by a glutamine (Q) residue [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref022">

       </xref>
       ]. However, nucleobase 12642 in the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was a T nucleotide, thereby changing glutamine (Q) to histidine (H). More interestingly, there were no glutamine codons in the sequence (from -273 to +192) around this site, as also observed in the corresponding site in the genomes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9. Therefore, the LH|AG region may represent a potential alternative cleavage site of 3CLpro to cleave between NSP9 and NSP10. A similar phenomenon may occur at the cleavage site between NSP10 and NSP12 of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, where the CAG codon has mutated to CAC causing the conversion of Q to H in amino acid sequence (

       To determine the evolutionary position of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, the RdRp, S, N and p10 proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees of the RdRp, S and N proteins illustrated that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, Eidolon bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY24/2006 (Ei-BatCoV Kenya), Rousettus bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY06/2006 (Ro-BatCoV Kenya) and Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains all belong to group D of the genus

Within this cluster the two Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 strains (346 and 356) formed a distinct lineage that was a sister-group to Ro-BatCoV Kenya and the Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains (maximum bootstrap value of 100%). However, a strikingly different phylogenetic pattern was observed in the distinctive p10 protein (

       Evidence for heterologous recombination of a reovirus p10 gene recombination into Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1

       To exclude the false amplification of DNA polymerase or the inaccurate assembly of NGS data, the NGS data was analyzed further. Read mapping determined that there were a set of reads that covered the upstream junction site (i.e. the recombination break-point) between N and p10 genes, and a downstream junction site between the p10 and NS7a genes (

       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g004">

       The presence of subgenomic mRNAs is strong evidence of coronavirus replication in the infected cells. To determine if the bat, which sample was collected from, was likely the natural host of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, subgenomic mRNAs in the sample were probed with a comprehensive set of primers. The PCR products were confirmed on an agarose gel. As displayed in
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g006">
        Fig 6C
       </xref>
       , the lowest band marked with a red arrow on each lane was the specific amplicon from each subgenomic mRNA as demonstrated in

        Fig 6B
       </xref>
       . However, additional amplified bands were also compatible with this inference. As shown as an example on the lane of the E gene, the upper band indicates that subgenomic mRNA NS3 was simultaneously amplified in this reaction. On each lane the lowest band was cloned for sequencing, while other bands were purified and sequenced directly. Since the specific amplicon of the subgenomic mRNA NS7c failed to be cloned into the vectors, the PCR product was used as template for a second round of nested PCR. The product was then confirmed as shown in the lane of NS7c-2 in

For this purpose, the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was transiently expressed in BHK-21 cells as well as the p10 gene of Pulau virus, which was used as a positive control. Wright-Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining showed that both genes had the same function to induce the formation of cell syncytia (

       The p10 subgenomic mRNA identified in the samples confirmed that the p10 gene could be transcribed from the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. However, due to the failure of virus isolation (despite a great effort), there is no effective way to judge whether the p10 gene could be expressed during the virus replication cycle. Therefore, an artificial plasmid was constructed containing the transcribed p10 subgenomic mRNA, which confirmed the functional expression of p10 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g008">
        Fig 8C
       </xref>
       ). When the plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells, once again, cell syncytia were observed with Wright-Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g008">

       ). Thus, this indirect evidence suggests that the p10 gene functions during the replication cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunofluorescence staining also showed that polyclonal antibodies of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 p10 protein reacted with the p10 protein of Pulau virus (

       ). In addition, the cross-reactivity further proved that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 might have the same origin as those of fusogenic orthoreoviruses.

       As the p10 protein of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is the first report of FAST protein in an enveloped virus, the conserved amino acids of the p10 protein of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 were mutated to determine whether they play a vital role in cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation as those sites in the p10 protein of reoviruses (

      </xref>
      ], Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is sufficiently divergent to represent a novel bat coronavirus. More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contains a p10 protein located at the 3’-end of the genome that appears to have captured from a bat-origin orthoreovirus by heterologous recombination.
     </p>

      Homologous recombination events frequently occur during the viral RNA replication of coronaviruses, and are important for their evolution [

      group A possess an HE gene [

      ], and which would represent another case of inter-family recombination, although it has also been proposed that the HE gene might be captured from host RNA [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref032">
       32

      ]. In the current study, sequence, phylogenetic and functional analyses demonstrated that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was likely derived from an ancestral orthoreovirus, although that it occupies a divergent position in the phylogeny suggests that the direct ancestor of the recombination event has yet to be sampled. Hence, these data provide clear evidence for a putative inter-family recombination between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus. The mechanisms that underpin such inter-family heterologous recombination clear merit further investigation.

      The biggest difference between fusogenic and nonfusogenic orthoreoviruses is the presence/absence of a small protein encoded by the segment S1 of the genome, termed the fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein. The FAST proteins are the only known nonenveloped reovirus fusogens that can mediate cell-to-cell, but not virus-cell, membrane fusion to induce the formation of syncytia [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref020">
       20
      </xref>
      ], and which might promote the dissemination of virus among cells [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref037">
       37
      </xref>
      ]. Thus, the FAST proteins are the pathogenic determinants of fusogenic orthoreoviruses. To date, the FAST family comprises six members including p10 proteins encoded by avian- and bat-origin orthoreoviruses, p13, p14 and p15 encoded by broome virus, reptilian reovirus and bush viper reovirus and baboon orthoreovirus respectively, and p16 and p22 encoded by aquareoviruses. Intriguingly, a specific p10 gene was identified in Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, so that this is the first report of a FAST protein in an enveloped virus and hence could represent the seventh member of FAST family.

      Unfortunately, the isolation of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 failed on cell culture in the present study, so it is difficult to determine the role of p10 gene during the life cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. However, functional analysis showed that the coronavirus p10 gene could induce syncytium formation in the transfected cells, in the same manner as orthoreoviruses, which might be beneficial for cell-to-cell virus spread. It is therefore possible that the p10 protein enhances the transmission potential of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. Previous studies of the potential recombination between coronavirus and influenza C virus revealed the pivotal role of the shared HE gene for the pathogenesis of
      <italic>
       betacoronavirus

      group A [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref038">
       38
      </xref>
      ]. Interestingly, human coronavirus HKU1, OC43 and bovine coronaviruses employ the HE protein to mediate receptor-destroying enzyme activity late in the infection cycle to facilitate viral progeny release and achieve efficient virus dissemination [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref039">

      Compared to nonfusogenic orthoreoviurses, fusogenic orthoreoviruses can cause severe pneumonia when infecting humans [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref040">
       40

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref041">
       41
      </xref>
      ], further implying that p10 is an important pathogenic determinant. Thus, the recombination of the reovirus-originated p10 into the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 may enable the novel virus to disseminate and replicate rapidly in the host, in turn leading to severe infections. In recent years, several coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused severe pneumonia among humans [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref042">
       42

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref043">
       43
      </xref>
      ]. Because of the presence of human infected fusogenic orthoreoviruses such as Melaka virus (MelV) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref044">
       44
      </xref>
      ], there is obviously some risk that cross-family recombination events such as that described here may generate a novel coronavirus with altered pathogenicity. Our study therefore highlights the importance of investigating the mechanisms that might enable possible recombination between human coronaviruses and orthoreoviruses.

      In the protein sequence of ORF1ab encoded replicase of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, the regular P1 position at two 3CLpro cleavage sites, NSP9/NSP10 and NSP10/NSP12, contains a Q to H mutation which may impair the proteolytic efficacy and the release of NSP9, NSP10 and NSP12. As NSP12 is a typical RNA polymerase and the core of replication-transcription complexes (RTC) and NSP10 usually serves as a molecular switch that can interact with multiple NSPs to form complexes, the replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 might be suppressed by the decrease of release of these vital elements. It is also interesting to note that a similar situation may be observed at the NSP13/NSP14 cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus HKU1 and human coronavirus NL63. Clearly, further investigation will need to focus on the isolation of the virus, construction of infectious clones, and the virulence and replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 influenced by knockout of p10 gene and/or reverse mutation of cleavage sites.

      Phylogenetically distinct virus species or lineages have been reported co-circulating in certain bat populations [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref046">
       46
      </xref>
      ]. Under this situation, co-infections of single host cells—the necessary requisite for recombination—are possible. By careful sequence analysis we show that the heterologous recombination event placed the p10 gene in Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is genuine. Previous studies showed the existence of p10-harboring orthoreoviruses in bat populations [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref049">

      ], such that co-infections with bat coronaviruses and hence recombination events are clearly possible. In addition, a previous study reported that mammalian orthoreovirus, a type of nonfusogenic orthoreovirus, was isolated from a SARS-CoV patient along during the in 2003 outbreak [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005883.ref050">
       50
      </xref>
      ]. We believe that future studies should investigate co-infections in specific bat cell lines using a coronavirus similar to Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 or Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and the relevant orthoreoviruses, from which it will be possible to reveal more of the underlying basis of heterologous coronavirus recombination.

       Nested subgenomic mRNAs are generated during the replication cycle of coronaviruses. Hence, the identification of subgenomic mRNAs in the samples provides strong evidence for the replication of coronavirus. To analyze the possibility of replication in the newly identified bat coronavirus, primers were designed to determine the presence of viral subgenomic mRNAs in the coronavirus-positive bat rectal swab samples. Forward primers were designed targeting the leader sequence at the 5’-end of the complete genome and the putative subgenomic mRNAs, while reverse primers were designed within the ORFs or downstream of the corresponding gene (primer sequences are shown in

Specific amplicons, that matched the expected length, were purified and then cloned into the pMD-18T vector for sequencing, while the additional suspected bands on the agarose gels were excised, purified, and then subjected to direct sequencing. Since the specific amplicon of subgenomic mRNA NS7c failed to be cloned into the vectors, the PCR product was used as a template for a second round of nested PCR. The product was then confirmed with agarose gel electrophoresis and the band was cloned for sequencing.

       Syncytial analysis and cell staining
      </title>
      <p>
       In the cells infected with avian- or bat-origin fusogenic orthoreoviruses, the formation of cell syncytia depends on a p10 protein, which is encoded by the first ORF in segment S1 of the reovirus genome. It was previously demonstrated that amino acid residues of p10 proteins could be sorted into absolutely, highly, moderately and non-conserved amino acids [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       Sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 most likely originated in an orthoreovirus. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that although the majority of key amino acids and motifs of the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 p10 protein were conserved, there were 8 amino acids differences (including 2 deletions) among the 28 so-called ‘absolutely conserved’ amino acids that characterize members of the FAST family (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g007">
        Fig 7

       ). Hence, it is necessary to explore the potential role of the p10 gene during the life cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1.
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine whether the putative p10 protein could play the same role as homologous proteins of avian and bat orthoreoviruses, the p10 gene was cloned into the pCAGGS vector and the recombinant plasmid (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005883.g008">
        Fig 8A
       </xref>
       ) was then transfected into BHK-21 cells using Polyethylimine (PEI, Polysciences Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the appropriate time post-transfection, cell-to-cell fusion was observed for the syncytium formation under the light microscope using Wright-Giemsa staining and an indirect immunofluorescence assay employing the polyclonal antibodies prepared above. The p10 gene of Pulau virus, a bat orthoreovirus [

        49

       ], was also cloned into the pCAGGS vector to serve as a positive control. Cells transfected with an empty pCAGGS vector were used as a mock control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to confirm that p10 can be transcribed or translated during the replication cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. We confirmed that the p10 gene could be transcribed from the genome during the replication cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, with the p10 subgenomic mRNA representing a distinct signal. Further, we cloned the deduced p10 subgenome into a pcDNA3.0-derived vector to construct an artificial plasmid (

        Fig 8C

       ), which could be transcribed out of an mRNA that is consistent with the p10 subgenomic mRNA in the infected cells of the host. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells and cell syncytia were observed as described above. The recombinant plasmid of Pulau virus p10 gene was still served as positive control. Cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.0 vector were used as mock control.

        Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region. In this chapter, we outline the prevailing information regarding the emergence and epidemiology of this virus, its mode of transmission and pathogenicity, its clinical features, and the potential strategies for prevention.

      This newly emerging, highly pathogenic respiratory virus is closely related to the virus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–03. Both viruses are beta CoVs of zoonotic origin and cause similar clinical presentations. Although the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV infection and mode of transmission to humans is not known, one factor appears to be common to all primary cases; they are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East region. Most secondary cases, on the other hand, have occurred as a result of human-to-human transmission. Indeed, several well-documented outbreaks have occurred in healthcare settings, often in elderly men with comorbidities (

      ). Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is an ongoing public health threat, particularly for the Middle East. The fact that there is no effective antiviral drug or approved vaccine available against MERS-CoV makes the threat even more worrisome (

       MERS-CoV is an enveloped, single-strand, and positive-sense RNA virus, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Although CoVs are very common and can infect a variety of different animals, including cats, pigs, and bats, they rarely jump species barrier and infect humans. Human CoVs (HCoVs) were first isolated in mid-1960s, and until 2002, only two viruses, namely, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were known to infect humans (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">
        Forni et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Currently, six CoVs have been shown to infect humans. Except for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, all others are associated with mild illnesses resembling common cold.

       CoVs are grouped into four genera, α, β, γ, and δ. The β-CoVs are further subgrouped in four lineages or clades, A–D (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">
        Milne-Price et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). Although MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV belong to the same genus and both cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, phylogenetic and sequencing data suggests that MERS-CoV is in fact more closely related to several bat CoVs (BtCoVs) than to SARS-CoV (

        Milne-Price et al., 2014

       ). These findings suggest that MERS-CoV probably is originated from a BtCoV
ancestor (

       ). The fact that CoVs are RNA viruses exhibiting high rates of mutation and recombination, and a propensity to cross species barrier, increases the risk of new variants emerging with higher virulence and transmission (

       The replication cycle of MERS-CoV consists of a number of important steps: attachment and entry into host cell, uncoating and release of viral RNA, transcription and translation of viral specific genes, replication of viral genomic RNA, and assembly and release of progeny virions from the infected cell. As is typical of most RNA viruses, all of these steps take place in the cytoplasm of the host cell (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">
        de Wit et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). The initial attachment of MERS-CoV to its susceptible host cells is mediated by the viral envelop spike glycoprotein S binding to its cellular receptor, CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">
        Lu et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">
        Raj et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). A number of different cell types express DPP4 and hence are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection including pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelia, vascular endothelium, as well as a subset of mononuclear cells (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">
        Meyerholz et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">
        Yu et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Following attachment, the virus enters the susceptible cell by fusion of its envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via receptor-mediated endocytosis (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">
        de Wit et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). Once in the cytoplasm of the target cell, the virus particle uncoats and the positive-sense viral RNA binds to ribosomes, and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is translated. This enzyme in turn transcribes full-length negative-sense RNA that forms the template for the production of positive-sense viral genome. The viral polymerase also generates various individual mRNAs that are translated into viral proteins. Viral structural proteins and viral genomic RNA are assembled into new virus particles in the rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and eventually released out of the cell by exocytosis. From the infected host, it appears that the virus is shed in nasal secretions (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
        Adney et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). Interestingly, in bats, a recent study revealed that DPP4 receptor is rarely expressed in epithelial cells of respiratory tract, but highly expressed in epithelial cells of intestinal tract, indicating that fecal–oral is probably the main mode of transmission in bats (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">
        Widagdo et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Of all the documented cases to date, there is no evidence for the transmission of the virus from bats or their droppings directly to humans. We also have limited data on the survival of the virus outside its host. When the virus was added to milk from dromedary camels, goats, or cow and stored at 4°C or 22°C, the virus could be recovered up to 72 and 48 hours, respectively (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">
        van Doremalen et al., 2013

       ). Pasteurization of the milk, however, completely destroyed MERS-CoV infectivity (

       The current prevalent view is that MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that entered the human population in the Arabian Peninsula, via direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. Studies indicate that the virus had been circulating in the camel population for decades, and only recently “jumped” the species barrier to infect humans. What are the factors that precipitated the virus to cross the species barrier are unknown. Most of the confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans have been via person-to-person transmission. The epidemiological elements in the transmission of MERS-CoV appear to be factors related to the virus, the host, and the environment. Cases have occurred as sporadic infections, family clusters, or outbreaks in healthcare settings (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">
        Oboho et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Although the infection is limited and nonsustained, outbreaks in healthcare settings have been particularly extensive and worrisome. The nonspecific initial symptoms, late diagnosis, and inadequate infection control measures have all contributed to the outbreaks in healthcare settings (

       ). Although MERS-CoV cases have been detected in many countries around the world, almost all have been directly or indirectly linked to the Middle East region (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0015">
        Table 8.2
       </xref>
       ). One of the most notable outbreaks outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in May 2015 (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">
        Lee and Wong, 2015
       </xref>
       ). A single infected man returning from the Middle East caused a hospital outbreak in which 185 individuals were infected (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">
        Kim et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). The epidemiological pattern observed in the Korean outbreak was similar to that observed in the Middle East; more males than females were affected, most of the 38 patients who died had underlying conditions such as respiratory disorders, cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular problems, or diabetes (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">
        Kim et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). It is noteworthy that the death rate was lower in the cases from South Korea compared to those reported from Saudi Arabia (23% vs 47%) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">

       Although more than 80% of MERS-CoV cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, the virus clearly has the potential of spreading to other countries. Thus there is an obvious need to detect, respond, and contain any outbreak of MERS-CoV cases if we want to prevent the global spread of the virus. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. There are a number of risk factors prevalent in some of the countries of the Middle East which support the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">
        Buliva et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). These risk factors include political instability, famine and war, less developed healthcare infrastructure, weak public health and surveillance systems, increased population growth and mobility, climate change, and urbanization (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">
        Buliva et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). In order to prevent the emergence and spread of infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV, it is essential to address the underlying causes and risk factors. Needless to say, these are major challenges for any country, let alone the Eastern Mediterranean Region. To successfully address these challenges, it will require not only funding, establishment of robust and effective surveillance systems, and national and international corporations but also above all, peace and security in the region.

       Infection with MERS-CoV, in its initial description, resembled “SARS-like” illness (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">
        Chan et al., 2015a
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">
        Chan et al., 2015b
       </xref>
       ). Further analysis of the epidemiological, virological, and clinical aspects of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed important differences between the two viruses. Identifying unique aspects of MERS-CoV helped to explain how the epidemic evolved and the steps that could be taken to prevent its spread (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">
        Chan et al., 2015a

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">
        Chan et al., 2015b
       </xref>
       ). Serological studies have indicated that most dromedary camels in Africa and the Middle East, but not other animals such as sheep, goats, and cows, were seropositive for MERS-CoV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">
        Reusken et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). Moreover, seroprevalence in dromedary camels appears to vary, with high rates reported in animals from Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Sudan and lower rates in animals from Tunisia (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">
        Ali et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Intriguingly, dromedaries from Australia, Canada, the United States, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan have been reported to be seronegative for MERS-CoV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">
        Omrani et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Importantly, population-based seroepidemiologic studies indicated that the seroprevalence of the virus was several folds higher in people who have been exposed to camels compared to those in the general population (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">
        Müller et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Worldwide, it is estimated that there are around 30 million camels of which 95% are dromedaries. Dromedary camels are very popular in the Middle East where they are used not only for their meat and milk but also for cultural and recreational purposes. Whether camels are the primary reservoir for MERS-CoV infection in humans or merely an intermediate host for the transmission of the virus from a yet unidentified host remains to be proven (

       Accumulating serologic and molecular evidence indicates that the virus in dromedaries is genetically similar to MERS-CoV in humans, supporting the notion that dromedary camels could be the potential source of infection to human (

       ). Indeed, MERS-CoV antibodies have been isolated in dromedary camels across the Arabian peninsula, North Africa, and Eastern Africa dating from as far back as the 1990s (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">
        Milne-Price et al., 2014

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">
        Omrani et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). This finding suggests that MERS-CoV may have been circulating in dromedaries for over 20 years before it was first recognized as a cause of human infection (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
        Aly et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). In a recent study, a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in an individual who had direct contact with a dromedary camel (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">
        Azhar et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). Sequence analysis of the virus isolated from the case and the camel was identical, clearly indicating that MERS-CoV can indeed be transmitted from camels to human (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">
        Azhar et al., 2014
       </xref>
       ). It appears that active infection with release of the virus in nasal secretions, particularly during the incubation period, is important for the transmission of the virus to humans (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">
        Alraddadi et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). Where and how the camels acquired the infection remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that bats could be the potential source (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">
        Omrani et al., 2015

       ). Indeed, MERS-CoV-like viruses have been identified in certain species of bats (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">
        Woo et al., 2006
       </xref>
       ). The bats are present in most parts of the world and often infected with various zoonotic viruses. Thus it is plausible that at some point in the past, camels acquired the infection from bats, leading to a sustained infection in the camel population (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">
        Fig. 8.3
       </xref>
       ). MERS-CoV RNA has been identified in the milk, nasal secretion, and feces of dromedary camels (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">
        Omrani et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). Since camels and humans are often in close contact, particularly in the Arab Gulf States, humans would be at increased risk of contracting the virus from actively infected animals (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">
        Mackay and Arden, 2015

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">
        Reusken et al., 2015

       ). Indeed, MERS-CoV seropositivity in shepherds and those working in slaughterhouses in Saudi Arabia has been reported to be an order of magnitude higher than in the general population (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
        Arabi et al., 2017
       </xref>
       ). Although possible, no evidence currently exists to support the transmission of MERS-CoV from bats to humans directly. What is certain is that transmission of the virus can occur from camels to humans, but the process is still not fully understood (

       CoV is a common cause of mild respiratory tract infection manifesting as common cold. It is estimated that approximately one-third of all upper respiratory tract infections in adults are due to CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the exceptions.

       ). The initial clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection can range from asymptomatic to low-grade fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and less frequently diarrhea and vomiting. Progression to more severe disease is characterized by the symptoms of shortness of breath, severe pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death (

       ). The severity of the infection appears to vary depending on the age of the patient and any underlying conditions. Adults over the age of 50 years and with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal or lung disease, cancer, and heart disease are at increased risk of developing severe disease and death (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">
        Badawi and Ryoo, 2016
       </xref>
       ). Although the vast majority of confirmed cases have been in male adults, children are also susceptible to infection, albeit at lower rate and with milder disease (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">
        Al-Tawfiq et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). Based on limited data, MERS-CoV infection in pregnancy can also lead to maternal and perinatal disease and death (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">
        Assiri et al., 2016

       ). Not surprisingly, the severity of infection and the risk of transmission of MERS-CoV are significantly increased in environments such as hospitals (

       The clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, especially in early stages of the infection, are typically nonspecific and can resemble a number of acute respiratory tract infections. However, acute febrile respiratory illness in a patient with a recent travel history to the Middle East or direct/indirect contract with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV should be enough suspicion to request laboratory testing for MERS-CoV. Studies indicate that viral replication and shedding is higher in lower compared to upper respiratory tract (

       ). Hence, for laboratory diagnosis, lower respiratory tract specimens such as tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or pleural fluid are preferred over upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal swab (

       The assay of choice for the laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory samples. This assay was established soon after the identification of MERS-CoV back in 2012 (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">
        Zaki et al., 2012
       </xref>
       ). RT-PCR is not only very sensitive but also importantly a fairly rapid technique, which is essential for early diagnosis and quarantine implementation. The virus can also be cultured. A number of different cell lines are susceptible for in vitro infection, including Vero and LLC-MK2 cells (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">
        Zaki et al., 2012
       </xref>
       ). However, cell culture approach is very slow and not easily adaptable to every diagnostic laboratory, hence the preference of RT-PCR. For determining past infection or for surveillance studies, the detection of antibodies to MERS-CoV using serological assay, such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), can be performed (

       Treatment and Prevention

       Currently, no specific antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection. Supportive care and prevention of complications are the main management options that are available. However, efforts are underway for the development of therapeutic and vaccine candidates. In a marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection, several compounds, including ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon-β1b, and interferon-α2B, alone or in combinations, have shown varying degree of success (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">
        Chan et al., 2015a

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">
        Falzarano et al., 2013
       </xref>
       ). Similarly, passive immunotherapy with neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV has also shown some therapeutic value in inhibiting viral replication (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">
        Luke et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). In terms of vaccines, several potential candidates have been developed and are in different stages of clinical testing (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">
        Du et al., 2016
       </xref>
       ). The possibility of developing an effective vaccine based on MERS-CoV spike protein is promising (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">
        Haagmans et al., 2015
       </xref>
       ). In the absence of licensed antiviral or vaccine, current strategies of combating MERS-CoV infection are aimed at reducing the risk of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmissions. Strategies recommended include avoidance of drinking unpasteurized camel milk, limiting direct contact with a sick animal, avoidance of close contact, and sharing of utensils with an infected individual, using PPE when in direct contact with an infected person and proper hand hygiene. In addition, early recognition and laboratory confirmation of infected cases, segregation/isolation of infected cases, and contact tracing and strict implementation of infection control measures in healthcare settings are all essential for controlling and preventing of MERS-CoV infection and spread.

        Network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks. This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.

      Introduction
     </title>
     <p id="Par2">
      Transmission of infectious disease through contact among individuals increases the risk of outbreaks with epidemic potential. However, understanding how diseases spread over networks of contacts remains a challenge. In particular, outbreaks of potentially devastating infections, such as SARS (2003), Ebola (2014–2015), and Zika (2015–2016), have shown that the dynamics behind the spread of disease has become more complex, limiting our ability to predict and control epidemics. In this regard, patterns of disease transmission should be used to design specific public health strategies to enhance sustainable capacity while building activities to improve government responses to infectious diseases. Therefore, an analysis of disease dynamics based on the contact patterns can be used to build practical guidance while framing disease prevention and management strategies.
     </p>
     <p id="Par3">
      The interpersonal contact patterns of disease transmissions have often been discussed in a network context while modelling epidemics

      . Most potential disease contact takes place in localized communities among individuals occupying a local geographic space around the diseased. If such contacts are repeated within a given period, certain patterns of links will arise. These link patterns can be represented as networks, which show the spread of an infection among individuals. Thus, certain disease dynamics represented in a contact network can be characterised by topologies.
     </p>
     <p id="Par4">
      Previous studies on super-spreaders have identified two major types of networks, small-world network
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
        5
       </xref>
      </sup>
      and scale-free network

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
        6
       </xref>
      </sup>
      . In the small-world network, a small number of shortcuts are discovered either by randomly connecting the nodes or randomly rewiring the links. From the shortcuts, it can be inferred that the average node length between any two individuals is shortened, thereby making geographic distance a causal factor in epidemic outbreaks
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
        7
       </xref>
      </sup>
      . In the small-world network context, thus, it is important to control the super-spreading events to prevent completely new outbreaks
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">

       </xref>
      </sup>
      . In the scale-free network, on the other hand, the number of contacts per individual exhibits a power-law distribution of infection links. The variation in the connectivity distribution of the scale-free network is infinite, because it does not exhibit the threshold phenomenon. Hence, an outbreak can occur at any time
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
        10
       </xref>
      </sup>
      . It can be inferred from both networks that the average shortest path length and a small degree of separation are important factors in the epidemic network analysis
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">
        11
       </xref>
      </sup>
      . Furthermore, the super-spreading characteristic of epidemics has been associated with the spatial proximity of neighbouring nodes in the network
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
        5

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">

       </xref>
      </sup>
      . Localised transmission of the epidemic is facilitated by high clustering coefficients, because of the close spatial proximity in node connectivity and its influence on their relation. Thus, nodes with a high spatial proximity tend to intensify super-spreading events within clusters, making it easy for the disease to spread locally over the considered population or areas.
     </p>
     <p id="Par5">
      It is known that three factors can cause a disproportionately large number of secondary contacts during super-spreading events

      : host factors (including physiological, behavioural, and immunological factors); viral factors (including virulence and co-infection factors); and environmental factors (including density, failure to recognise the disease, inter-hospital transfers, and airflow dynamics). Among these various factors, previous studies have focused specifically on the behaviour of the host and environmental factors in explaining the outbreak of SARS and MERS
      <sup>

      . It has been established that certain behaviours of the hosts, such as doctor shopping (visiting multiple doctors and facilities), play a critical role in the spread of infectious disease, as multiple visits by the super-spreaders can lead to the contamination of several medical facilities. In addition to the behaviour of the infected individual, a high population density also correlates to a higher number of infections emanating from both the SARS and MERS hosts, because the probability of infection in such a setting tends to be high

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">
        15

      . Given that the edges in the epidemic network represent physical proximity, a high level of clustering implies that infection occurs locally and spreads rapidly

      The 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea has been paid much attention as the outbreak was the first and biggest to occur outside Saudi Arabia, where the disease was identified in 2012. It has been known that the human-to-human transmission of MERS-coronavirus (CoV), which is a viral respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus, is relatively limited owing to its lower level of contagiousness. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">

      , MERS is thought to be transmitted through respiratory secretions. However, the particular way in which the virus spreads is not fully understood. During the MERS epidemic of 2015, 186 people across 16 healthcare facilities were infected, of whom 39 lost their lives. This biggest outbreak in a relatively short time began with an ‘index patient’, who had visited the Middle East and returned to Korea on May 4. The patient sought treatment for respiratory symptoms at several healthcare facilities and was later confirmed to have a MERS infection on May 20. By then, 31 people had come in contact with the patient, including family members, patients, visitors and hospital staff. In one instance of contact, a second patient was exposed to MERS while sharing an emergency room where the index patient sought care. The two patients became super-spreaders, assumed to generate many transmission events. Thus, they were likely to initiate infection among the susceptible population. Our expectation is that super-spreaders are more likely to hold certain structural advantages in facilitating continued transmission.

      This study investigates the spread of infections over networks of contacts among individuals by exploring the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea. We assume that the spread of a disease in a population depends on both the dynamics of the disease transmission and the structure of the contact networks over which they spread

      . One perspective contends that the hosts who transmit the MERS infection are those who are highly central in the contact network. Thus, many neighbouring hosts form relational ties to others vulnerable to infection. Another perspective argues that if a host has already been infected and other hosts are not yet exposed, healthcare facilities play the pertinent role of delivering the infectious virus to other susceptible hosts. We analyze structural network properties of the epidemic transmission by examining both the relationship matrix of the infection tracing of infected individuals (from-whom-to-whom) and the bipartite transmission routes of infected individuals by healthcare facilities visited for treatment. In this study, we explore two research questions about the MERS outbreak in Korea: (a) How did the infectious disease become widespread through a network in a relatively short period of time?; and (b) How did a small fraction of individual hosts spread the MERS virus to a majority of the population?

A personal contact is defined as the person-to-person route. The format for a personal contact is a daily record. For every pair of individual hosts between whom infectious contacts occurred on a given date, there is a daily record including the source (infector) and target individuals (infected) presented with the spread of the MERS infection. A hospital contact is defined as a hospital-acquired infection, also known as nosocomial infection. A contact occurs when an infected individual visits healthcare facilities for a limited time period for MERS diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up visit records. Each hospital contact corresponds to an actual visit of the individual hosts and includes the date on which the contact event occurred.

Among the 186 confirmed cases (including one case confirmed by China), the rates of infection were confirmed to be as follows: 44.1% (82 cases) among in- or out-patients sharing wards with the MERS patient; 34.4% (64 cases) among the hospitalised MERS patient’s cohabiting family members or visitors; and 21.0% (39 cases) among the healthcare workers or staff employed at the MERS-affected hospital

For hospital-acquired infection, therefore, individual hosts are connected only by co-presence in hospitals, and hospitals are connected only by having individual hosts in common. Thus, the exposed contacts through which the infection can spread are represented by the co-presence of two individual hosts in the same hospitals. All the data in MS Excel, network measures, and visual displays of disease contact relations are produced using UCINET 6

       This study examines the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea using network analysis tools such as the indicators of centrality, egocentric network, core-periphery, and cut-points. First, centrality pertains to the node’s (as unit of analysis: individual host) position in a network through specific analysis that is preoccupied with the degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector of the geodesic distances

         30
        </xref>
       </sup>
       . Then, the egocentric network is used to identify the topologies of the contact networks in which single individual hosts are bound with their neighbouring individual hosts to reveal the link between direct contact and the spread of the MERS infection

         31

       . Furthermore, the core-periphery structures in a given network can reveal how the infection is transmitted locally or globally through the interaction of the core and periphery

       . Finally, a cut-point approach is used to identify the key hosts whose removal from the network would divide the network into un-connected parts, indicating a potential weakness in the network or disruption of the infection transmission flow

       . The personal contact network was assumed to have distinct clusters of individual hosts exposed to the path of MERS transmission, whereas the geodesics among these clusters were small. In a given network of personal contacts, the overall network density of 0.014 implies that only 1.4% of potential personal connections were actually realized. The average path length was 3.131 (disregarding the directness of relationships), and the average clustering coefficient was 0.258, which is significantly larger than the value for the corresponding classical random network, 1.117/162 = ∼0.007 (Table

       ). Thus, the network was considered to have a small-world property (small-world index: 1.046) with the presence of a small number of highly connected hub hosts (scale-free characteristics). Additionally, the distance-based cohesion of 0.355 demonstrated a large fragmented network with a relatively weak structural cohesion. That is, the network would become disconnected if specific hosts who acted as shortcuts between the two clusters removed.

          Personal Contact Patterns in MERS Infection Transmission. The overall relations of infection transmission within the personal contact network; three connected sub-structures are identified with the k-core algorithm. A k-core is defined as a hierarchical set of hosts based on a range for each number of contacts they each have according to the degree of connection the hosts have in the network. All nodes represent hosts having contacted MERS infection. Thus, all hosts that generated a given transmission event to

          other hosts form a sub-structure, and any host that generated multiple transmission events will link multiple sub-structures. Colors correspond to the k-core partition (red: the first, blue: the second, black: the third group) and the size of the nodes in each k-core is proportional to the individual node eigenvector centrality values.

       In network analysis, the nodes are individual hosts, and the links between individuals represent interactions that may allow disease transmission. The descriptive statistics demonstrate that the average degree of infectious hosts was 1.117, which was quite low, given that there were 161 other hosts (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">
        2

       ). We see that the range of out-degree was significantly larger than that of the in-degree (minimum and maximum), and that there was more variability across the hosts in the out-degree than in the in-degree (standard deviations and variances). The coefficient variations for out-degree and in-degree were 5.87 and 0.47, respectively. Thus, the population was more heterogeneous in structural contact positions with regard to out-degree than with regard to in-degree. The overall centralization of out-degree was high at 46%, and the in-degree centralization was low at 2.4% of these theoretical maximums. We arrived at the conclusion that the network of disease transmission might have been dominated more by key hosts than by various groups of individuals. That is, the heterogeneity of the number of contacts tended to affect the spread and persistence of infection

       Network centrality

       We sought to investigate the degree centrality of MERS contact relations, because super-spreaders involved in disease transmission pathways are known for their role in disease dynamics. The degree centrality describes the extent to which an individual host may be cohesive to a network of personal contact relations. In the degree centrality results (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">
        2
       </xref>
       ), hosts #14 (M14) and #1 (M1) had higher percentages of out-degree links, indicating that they were in direct infectious contact with many other target hosts in the network, because each had more than 19% network centrality (46% for #14 and 19.3% for #1). Most other hosts in the network had relatively fewer connections. These direct contacts made hosts #1 and #14 more accessible to other hosts, generating several transmission chains that led to the infection of the susceptible target population in the network. This means that small fractions of highly connected ‘hub’ hosts acting as potential super-spreaders played a pertinent role in fueling and driving epidemics of infectious diseases (infectivity)
       <sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">

        –

        </xref>
       </sup>
       . In other words, both host #1 (the index case: the first host infected in a chain of transmission) and host #14 (secondary case: typical infectious host) were well-characterised super-spreaders who held prominent structural advantage in facilitating continued transmission of the infection to susceptible hosts in their neighbourhoods. By contrast, host #37 had a high in-degree and was more at risk of becoming infected through contact with other infectious individuals, followed by hosts #39, #162, and #179. In other words, the more often a host was exposed to a potential threat by way of coming in contact, the more vulnerable he or she was to the risks leading to the MERS infection (vulnerability).
      </p>
      <p id="Par15">
       Regarding betweenness centrality, which measures the extent to which a particular individual host lies between other hosts in the network, the overall network centralization was very low at 0.35% of the purely centralized network (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">
        2
       </xref>
       ). Thus, most contacts could be made in this network without the aid of any intermediary. Despite this structural constraint, hosts #16 and #76, along with the typical infectious host #14, provided a spatial link or pathway through which MERS was transmitted from the source to the target host populations. For instance, host #14, who acquired the infection through contact with infectious host #1, infected host #76, and the infection transmission continued to emerge through personal contacts within a population of susceptible hosts. Without the tie to bridge hosts, therefore, other susceptible individuals might have been largely isolated from MERS infections.
      </p>
      <p id="Par16">
       The closeness centrality indicates the potential independence of a host from the relation of disease contact. With closeness, hosts #1 and #14 had significant potential to make infectious contacts with the target host because of the shorter paths to transmission possibilities, thereby enabling the initial introduction and subsequent spread of MERS towards its target population with transitory contacts. As a result, overall closeness centralization was higher than betweenness centralization. This suggests that there were decentralized short-distance disease contact routes with centralised hub hosts. However, no significant mediation was observed (47.2%: the distributions of in-and out-closenesses could not be computed because the network was weakly connected).
      </p>
      <p id="Par17">
       Finally, the eigenvector of geodesic distances offers a measure of the diversity of a personal contact’s network. The results show that host #14 had the highest eigenvector centrality, indicating the consistent hub host of infection transmission in the personal contact network, which is more central to the main pattern of contact distances among all of the individual hosts (degree of inequality was 99.18% of the maximum possible; Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">

       Egocentric personal contract network

       To understand the modular structures of this disease contact matrix, egocentric personal contact networks were examined. The ego networks of personal contacts consist of both a focal infectious host (
       <italic>

       ) and a set of susceptible hosts (
       <italic>

       ), which received infectious contacts from the
       <italic>

       , and a measurement of contact relations among these
       <italic>
        alters
       </italic>
       . The results showed that host #14 was the infectious individual host having the largest egocentric network, and 74 individual hosts had established infectious contacts (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">
        3
       </xref>
       ). Among the 74 susceptible hosts in the network of host #14, four were direct person-to-person transmitted infections out of 5,402 possible infectious contact relations, which confirmed the presence of 0.07% of all possible contact relations of infection transmission between hosts. The results of other infectious hosts also show the very fragmented nature of egocentric contact network relationships. Thus, the spread of the MERS infection by hub infectious hosts was more likely in a small-world network, where the individual hosts were not tightly connected in local structures (see Supplementary Fig.

       Analysis of core-periphery structure and cut-point
      </title>
      <p id="Par19">
       A core-periphery structure based on the density of connections comprises at least a pair of core and periphery blocks. The core block has many intra-block connections, whereas the peripheral block has relatively few. Contact density was higher for core-to-core relations (0.3). Each core host contacted, on average, 30% of the other hosts in the core of this network and tended to transmit the MERS infection more densely among themselves, representing six identified hosts at a higher risk of infection: high out-degree hosts #1, #9, and #14 with high in-degree hosts #37, #46, and #67 (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">
        4
       </xref>
       ). Core hosts were also a source of infection transmission for peripheral hosts (0.108). However, this relation was significantly looser than the one at the core position (core hosts tended not to receive infection from peripheral hosts: 0.002). This shows that hosts in the core transmitted 54 times as many MERS infections to peripheral hosts as peripheral hosts infected core hosts. In other words, the personal contact clusters at the core position via hub hosts were considered to be very dense local structures, where a small number of tightly embedded hosts could cause the MERS infection to spread locally in a population.

       Additionally, a cut-point analysis as an indicator of network’s weak spots vulnerable to disruptions in the infection transmission flow was performed to determine the key hosts who could act as brokers among otherwise disconnected personal contact relations in the network. Around 141 blocks into which cut-points divided the network structure were identified, with 17 cut-point hosts {hosts #1, #3, #6, #14, #15, #16, #17, #36, #50, #52, #76, #118, #119, #123, #132, #135, and #143}. If those 17 hosts were removed from the personal contact relation, the network structure would be fragmented into 141 unconnected parts (red dots in Fig.

       ). We see that a number of hub infectious hosts with top-ranked centrality were in cut-point positions, suggesting that they may have been targeted for control strategies to limit the spread of the MERS infection in this population.

       We identified 43 healthcare facilities where patients sought treatment for respiratory symptoms related to the MERS infection between the months of May and July 2015. We assumed a probability of the introduction of the MERS virus proportional to the daily patient flow of each hospital. We then observed the timeline of the MERS epidemic, as reported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and calculated the probability of distributions for the time and place of the introduction of MERS in Korea.

       The largest posterior distribution was associated with an introduction of hospital-acquired outbreak in SSC (the full name of hospital abbreviations in Fig.

       </xref>
       ) on June 7, 2015, and over 60% of infection transmission was more likely to occur between June 6 and 16. The places where MERS was most likely to be introduced were SSC and PMH. Although SSC generated the highest probability of MERS transmission between infected and susceptible individuals, the earliest outbreak was observed in PMH on May 21, which failed to control MERS transmission from the index patient (host #1) to other susceptible neighbours. As shown in Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">

       </xref>
       , the epidemic in most healthcare facilities declined after June 7, because the sudden outbreak of MERS produced an epidemic time curve with a sudden onset and a rapid decline. The epidemic curve was suggestive of a mixed outbreak pattern, in which individual hosts were exposed to the common source (or point source) over a short time and spread infection to others via ongoing person-to-person contact with an average incubation period of 6.8 days (range 4–8 days).

       Network centrality of hospital contacts
      </title>
      <p id="Par23">
       Analyzing the contact relationships causing nosocomial infection and identifying the underlying network structure of hospital contact patterns are significant in defining how the nosocomial infection was structurally constructed and how the disease was transmitted. We examined network structures representing hospital contact relations weighted by locations of individual hosts and healthcare facilities. Accordingly, the links from infection transmission consisted of two nodes: individual hosts and hospitals they visited for MERS diagnosis and treatment. The exposed contacts through which the infection could spread are represented by the co-presence of two individual hosts in the same hospital. The bipartite graph of all pairs of nodes shows that eight healthcare facilities (SSC, PMH, DDH, DKH, PGH, SKH, HHC, and SKC) were more central than any of the individual hosts on the degree centrality measures (Table
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab5">
        5
       </xref>
       ). For instance, DKH had 14 links to MERS infection and transmission, whereas hosts #1 and #14 had only four and three links, respectively. It also shows that SSC was the most central and was followed by PMH, DDH, and DKH in this order. In other words, SSC, PMH, DDH, and DKH played key roles in the transmission of MERS via individual movements. There was more consistency among the healthcare facility scores, where SSC, PMH, DDH, and DKH had the highest scores across the centrality measures except in the closeness centrality, where DDH and DKH (where other 14 peripheral hosts visited and infected, respectively) were replaced by PGH in which hub host #14 had connection and passed MERS to host #118. As the eigenvector shows in this result, the largest given to SSC (0.996) provided further evidence of the likelihood of increasing the contact event among individual hosts with MERS infection possibilities.

       Looking at the individual hosts from the bipartite method, host #173, who had the highest score compared with that of other hosts, visited five healthcare facilities, four of which were low-centrality hospitals and one (SKH) was a central hospital. It was not as influential as individual hosts such as host #1, who visited two low-centrality hospitals and two central hospitals (SSC, PMH); host #14, who visited just three central hospitals (SSC, PMH, PGH); and host #76, who visited one low-centrality hospital and three central hospitals (SSC, SKH, SKC). In this case, we might expect infectious hub hosts #1 and #14 (along with #76) to have higher centrality scores (i.e., betweenness and closeness) than those of other hosts because they made contact with hosts in the majority of both high-and low-centrality healthcare facilities. We can see the network as comprising four clusters, and these relations were connected by having healthcare facilities in common (for instance, the #1 to #14 relation had the healthcare facility PMH in common; the #14 to #76 relation had SSC in common; the #76 to #173 relation had SKH in common; Fig.

       Core-periphery structure of hospital contact patterns

       A core-periphery analysis was conducted to further explore the network structure of hospital contact patterns. The result shows a core composed of 96 individual hosts including high out-degree hosts #1, #16 and #76 with high in-degree hosts #10, #39, #46, #74, and #107, who were all very likely to come in contact with three healthcare facilities (SSC, PMH, and DKH; Table

       ). In other words, the core healthcare facilities were more likely to increase the contact event among individual hosts with MERS risk, because they were all visited by 96 or more hosts. The peripheral hospitals had 37 or fewer (partition not shown) hosts. The remainder of the hosts was grouped into the periphery as both presenting less frequently and having few hospitals in common. A considerable number of healthcare facilities were also grouped as peripheral in the sense that they were less visited by infectious hosts, and these hosts had little in common.

       On the other hand, a host in the core visited either one or more core hospitals or one core hospital and at least three peripheral hospitals. For instance, nodes that interacted with host #1 were on the core side, whereas nodes that were likely to interact with host #14 were unexpectedly located in the same topological area of the periphery. Host #1 localised in a cluster containing another three healthcare facilities (SSC, PMH, and DKH), which were observed to associate with major nosocomial infections (see red, green, and blue dots in Fig.

The result also shows that core hosts presented themselves less frequently (0.016) at peripheral healthcare facilities, whereas peripheral hosts presented themselves somewhat more heavily (0.24) at core hospitals (Table

     <p id="Par27">
      Network analysis tools for exploring the infectious contact network provides a key opportunity to uncover the topologies of the contact networks of individuals in the transmission of MERS. However, the epidemiological topology of the contact network of infectious individuals and healthcare facilities has not, until now, been systematically investigated in relation to MERS. This underscores the necessity of understanding the structural properties in contact networks, particularly as infection transmission correlates to the super-spreading characteristic of epidemics and the prevalence of nosocomial infection in healthcare facilities.
     </p>
     <p id="Par28">
      The results show that a small number of healthcare facilities where hub infectious hosts tended to visit for a limited time for MERS diagnosis and treatment had an excessively certain influence on the early spread of MERS throughout the population. The MERS epidemic was more likely to be associated with the increased probability of contact events among individual hosts, and nosocomial infections rapidly increased the proportions of epidemic. Additionally, personal contacts initiated by super-spreaders were considered as potential risk factors for the persistence of the MERS infection on networks and contributed to the epidemic onset with high transmissibility in healthcare settings. In other words, both nosocomial and personal contacts might have played a dominant role in enhancing the risk of the transmission of MERS and subsequent infection in healthcare facilities in a relatively short period of time. This implies that infection prevention and control policies to limit the spread of diseases should aim at targeted surveillance programs and control strategies by investigating and monitoring the introduction and spread of infectious diseases through contact networks.
     </p>
     <p id="Par29">
      Our findings contribute to previous studies in several ways. It highlights the role of network analysis tools in analysing the epidemiological topologies of infectious diseases through comprehensive analytical methods. It also underscores the need for further research to develop different epidemiological models for a broader understanding of the structural properties of epidemic transmission. In addition, we reveal that the small-world network with scale-free dynamics is highly relevant to the emergence of complexification of the disease-spreading dynamics, and tends to minimise the average path distance over all the pairs of infectious and susceptible individuals. Finally, notwithstanding the relatively high prevalence and probability of person-to-person disease transmission based on the movement and relationships of individuals, our results confirmed that MERS was often a nosocomial infection.
     </p>
     <p id="Par30">
      Based on results, we suggest clear implications on strategy-driven interventions to prevent disease transmission. First, prevention and control efforts should target individuals with the highest likelihood of transmitting the disease. Our results justify the interventions directed towards investigating and monitoring the introduction and subsequent spread of diseases by highly infectious super-spreaders. To mitigate the super-spreading of the MERS among people in homes and in communities, home care for patients with mild symptoms should be provided under close medical observation, after patients and family caregivers must have received appropriate training on personal hygiene, basic infection prevention, and control measures. However, patients with worsening conditions should seek prompt medical attention following a monitor of their health status for 14 days after the exposure event

      </sup>
      . Secondly, our analysis reveals that relatively large tertiary hospitals have higher rates of MERS transmission than small community hospitals, because, in addition to poor disease control facilities, they typically have large numbers of patients and visitors who are engaged in doctor shopping
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">
        43

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">

       </xref>
      </sup>
      . Therefore, it is necessary to put effective quarantine and adequate facility ventilation on the agenda. Furthermore, to improve the response activities of hospital staff in infection prevention and control, timely education and training must be provided
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">
        43
       </xref>
      </sup>
      . It is also necessary that, regardless of the diagnosis, healthcare facilities should always share essential information in a timely manner with other facilities at the early stage of the outbreak. Finally, until more is understood about MERS, the government should provide reliable and timely information to the public, and establish an efficient disease-control system as preventive measures against the initial spread of MERS.
     </p>
     <p id="Par31">
      Despite the comprehensive findings, this study has several limitations. First, it is difficult to control any confounding factors that could influence the study results. Information, such as the determinants of the patient’s choice of healthcare facilities, are frequently not available, which can result in bias in the contact network analysis. Second, this study is based on contact network relationships as traced among individual hosts infected by the MERS. Therefore, it is necessary for future research to identify and analyse the patients in relation to the different patterns associated with both modes of transmission, person-to-person contact transmission and nosocomial infection, to provide a more profound insight into how they differ. Furthermore, the study is limited to the MERS-infected population in Korea. Therefore, the generalisability of findings may be limited. We believe that the limitations of this study can be overcome by comparing various epidemiology models that demonstrate the spread of infections with sufficiently large evidence-based datasets.

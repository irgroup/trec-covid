        Summary
       </title>
       <p>
        The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.

      Introduction
     </title>
     <p id="para10">
      Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, so reducing the risk of them infecting others.

      This definition differs from isolation, which is the separation of people who have been diagnosed with a contagious disease from people who are not sick; however, the two terms are often used interchangeably, especially in communication with the public.

      The word quarantine was first used in Venice, Italy in 1127 with regards to leprosy and was widely used in response to the Black Death, although it was not until 300 years later that the UK properly began to impose quarantine in response to plague.

      Most recently, quarantine has been used in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This outbreak has seen entire cities in China effectively placed under mass quarantine, while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from China have been asked to self-isolate at home or in state-run facilities.

      There are precedents for such measures. Citywide quarantines were also imposed in areas of China and Canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

      Quarantine is often an unpleasant experience for those who undergo it. Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects. Suicide has been reported,

      We undertook a Review of evidence on the psychological impact of quarantine to explore its likely effects on mental health and psychological wellbeing, and the factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review (

      of hospital staff who might have come into contact with SARS found that immediately after the quarantine period (9 days) ended, having been quarantined was the factor most predictive of symptoms of acute stress disorder. In the same study, quarantined staff were significantly more likely to report exhaustion, detachment from others, anxiety when dealing with febrile patients, irritability, insomnia, poor concentration and indecisiveness, deteriorating work performance, and reluctance to work or consideration of resignation. In another study,

      the effect of being quarantined was a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospital employees even 3 years later. Approximately 34% (938 of 2760) of horse owners quarantined for several weeks because of an equine influenza outbreak reported high psychological distress during the outbreak, compared with around 12% in the Australian general population.

      who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all dimensions. Health-care workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Health-care workers were also substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others. Conversely, one study

Where appropriate, employers might also wish to consider proactive approaches that allow employees to work from home if they wish to, both to avoid financial loss and to stave off boredom, while being mindful that staff in these situations might not be at their most productive and might benefit more from remote social support from their colleagues.

      What can be done to mitigate the consequences of quarantine?

     <p id="para350">
      During major infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be a necessary preventive measure. However, this Review suggests that quarantine is often associated with a negative psychological effect. During the period of quarantine this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can still be detected months or years later—albeit from a small number of studies

     </p>
     <p id="para360">
      In this regard, our results do not provide strong evidence that any particular demographic factors are risk factors of poor psychological outcomes after quarantine and therefore require specific attention. However, history of mental illness was only examined as a risk factor by one study. Previous literature suggests that psychiatric history is associated with psychological distress after experiencing any disaster-related trauma

      and it is likely that people with pre-existing poor mental health would need extra support during quarantine. There also appeared to be a high prevalence of psychological distress in quarantined health-care workers, although there was mixed evidence as to whether this group were at higher risk for distress than non-health-care workers who were quarantined. For health-care workers, support from managers is essential in facilitating their return to work

       Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psychological outcomes, perhaps unsurprisingly, as it stands to reason that the stressors reported by participants could have more of an effect the longer they were experienced for. Restricting the length of quarantine to what is scientifically reasonable given the known duration of incubation periods, and not adopting an overly precautionary approach to this, would minimise the effect on people. Evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine, and not extending it. For people already in quarantine, an extension, no matter how small, is likely to exacerbate any sense of frustration or demoralisation.

The ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reassure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them to communicate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic.

       It is also important that public health officials maintain clear lines of communication with people quarantined about what to do if they experience any symptoms. A phone line or online service specifically set up for those in quarantine and staffed by health-care workers who can provide instructions about what to do in the event of developing illness symptoms, would help reassure people that they will be cared for if they become ill. This service would show those who are quarantined that they have not been forgotten and that their health needs are just as important as those of the wider public. The benefits of such a resource have not been studied, but it is likely that reassurance could subsequently decrease feelings such as fear, worry, and anger.

       Altruism is better than compulsion
      </title>
      <p id="para440">
       Perhaps because of the difficulties of designing an appropriate study, no research was found which tested whether mandatory versus voluntary quarantine has a differential effect on wellbeing. In other contexts, however, feeling that others will benefit from one's situation can make stressful situations easier to bear and it seems likely that this is also true for home-based quarantine. Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe, including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre-existing serious medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined.

       Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable to ask people to self-quarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk.

      What we do not know

     <p id="para450">
      Quarantine is one of several public health measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and as shown in this Review, has a considerable psychological impact for those affected. As such, there is a question as to whether other public health measures that prevent the need to impose quarantine (such as social distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, and school closures) might be more favourable. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of such measures.

      The strengths and limitations of this Review must be considered. Because of the time constraints of this Review given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the reviewed literature did not undergo formal quality appraisal. Additionally, the Review was limited to peer-reviewed publications and we did not explore potentially relevant grey literature. The recommendations we have made apply primarily to small groups of people in dedicated facilities and to some extent in self-isolation. Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously. Furthermore, potential cultural differences need to be considered. Although this Review cannot predict exactly what will happen or provide recommendations that will work for every future population that is quarantined, we have provided an overview of the key issues and how they could be rectified in the future.
     </p>
     <p id="para470">
      There are also several limitations of the reviewed literature, which must be pointed out: only one study followed up participants over time, sample sizes were generally small, few studies directly compared participants quarantined with those not quarantined, conclusions based on certain study populations (eg, students) might not be generalisable to the wider public, and heterogeneity of outcome measures across studies make it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies. It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress using measures designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.

      Strengths of this Review include the hand-searching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search, contacting authors who sent full-texts of papers which were not available in full online, and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review.

      Conclusion
     </title>
     <p id="para490">
      Overall, this Review suggests that the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long lasting. This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse.

      However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be long-term consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the health-care system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it.

        Our search strategy was designed to inform this Review and a second review to be published elsewhere relating to adherence to quarantine. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The full list of search terms can be found in the
        <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1">

        . In brief, we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine (eg, “quarantine” and “patient isolation”) and psychological outcomes (eg, “psych” and “stigma”). For studies to be included in this Review, they had to report on primary research, be published in peer-reviewed journals, be written in English or Italian (as these are the languages spoken by the current authors), include participants asked to enter into quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 hours, and include data on the prevalence of mental illness or psychological wellbeing, or on factors associated with mental illness or psychological wellbeing (ie, any predictors of psychological wellbeing during or after quarantine). The initial search yielded 3166 papers, of which 24 included relevant data and were included in this Review. The screening process is illustrated in the

        The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.

     <p id="p0050">
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and belong to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans, birds, bats, snakes, mice and other wild animals [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">

      ]. Since the mid-1960s, seven known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">
       3
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. Four commonly detected HCoVs are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. In one study, 229E and OC43 accounted for approximately 15–29% of respiratory pathogens with relatively low virulence in humans [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">
       3
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Another epidemiological study in adults estimates that coronavirus causes about 15% of common colds [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. Other significant causes of upper respiratory infections include influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Group A Streptococci, EBV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
     </p>
     <p id="p0055">
      The three other strains of HCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have a different pathogenicity and lead to higher mortality rates in human populations. MERS-CoV was isolated from a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
       7
      </xref>
      ], and was subsequently responsible for 2494 cases and 858 deaths from 27 different countries (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">
       8
      </xref>
      ]. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were first recognized in China. SARS-CoV caused a total of 8422 probable SARS cases, 919 SARS-related deaths (case-fatality rate: 11%) and spread to 32 different countries or regions between November 2002 and August 2003 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected 73,230 people and caused 1871 deaths (case-fatality rate: 2.6%) and has spread to 25 countries, according to the State Council Information Office in Beijing, China (updated as of Feb. 17, 2020) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. As of this date, the number of confirmed and suspected cases is still increasing, as is the number of deaths, although there is a significant increase in the number of recovered patients as well.

      Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. It is not known for how long they have existed. Most of the time they are associated with mild disease, but every few years a highly virulent strain appears. The pathogenesis of these deadly epidemics is unclear. An examination of the structure of the viruses and the mechanism of infection may help elucidate and provide information for the development of effective treatment and possibly vaccines. Our purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of the epidemiology and history of SARS, as well as the lessons learned. The other aim is to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to better understand this deadly coronavirus and suggest prevention, treatment and management strategies.

       CoVs are enveloped with a non-segmented, positive-sense, single-strand RNA, with size ranging from 26,000 to 37,000 bases. This is the largest known genome among RNA viruses [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">
        11
       </xref>
       ]. The genomic structure of CoVs is as follows: 5′-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)–E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3′UTRpoly (A) tail. There are accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3′ end of genome [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">
        13
       </xref>
       ]. The S protein is responsible for receptor-binding and subsequent viral entry into host cells, the M and E proteins play important roles in viral assembly, and the N protein is necessary for RNA synthesis [

       CoVs can transmit across species barriers. SARS-CoV originated from bats of the Hipposideridae family, using palm civets as intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans [

       ]. The earliest patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan ultimately caused the epidemic known as COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Some of these patients had a history of contact with a wholesale seafood market in the early stages, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Subsequently, a large number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to the markets, suggesting the development of person-to-person spread [

      <p id="p0075">
       There are three primary ways to transmit the virus, including close person-to-person contact, aerosol transmission, and transmission by touch [

       ]. The virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">
        24
       </xref>
       ]. The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through “hidden transmission” [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">
        19
       </xref>
       ], in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.

      <p id="p0080">
       Before the first outbreak of SARS, a limited number of HCoVs such as HCoV-229E were frequently found to infect humans, and were widely circulating in human populations causing only mild illnesses like the common cold [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">

       ,

       ]. However, SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 present with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome [

       ]. Early on, these patients are usually treated with conventional medications which had no clinical benefit, resulting in spread to health care personnel. For those with flu-like symptoms or even more severe disease, it would not be immediately evident that this is an atypical and virulent form of a coronavirus. For comparison, influenza has an estimated mortality rate of 0.07%–0.2%. A high index of suspicion is helpful but not foolproof.

      A historical review of the epidemiology of SARS and how it was contained
     </title>
     <p id="p0100">
      It has been 17 years since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">
       43
      </xref>
      ]. This highly contagious atypical pneumonia first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. The initial cases were animal handlers in Guangzhou city having close contact with wild game food. It was suggested that civets could serve as an intermediate amplification host. Three months later, the SARS pandemic was rapidly and globally disseminated due to person-to-person transmission of the virus. On the February 21, 2003, a medical professor from Foshan in Guangdong province who was considered a “super-spreader” went to Hong Kong to visit his relatives. During his stay in Hong Kong, he transmitted the virus to 2 family members, 4 health care workers (HCWs) and 12 other nearby residents. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs, these patients spread the SARS-CoV to Hong Kong and other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. Eventually, 8422 people were infected in 32 countries and 919 (11%) died [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. In China, 5328 cases were reported and 349 (6.5%) perished between November 16, 2002 and June 3, 2003 [

     </p>
     <p id="p0105">
      At the beginning of the outbreaks in Hong Kong, mainland China and other areas, we were unfamiliar with the deadly SARS-CoV. It took about 3 months to complete the sequencing of this coronavirus [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">
       44
      </xref>
      ]. The global success in the fight against SARS was partly based on epidemiological and biological characteristics of the infectious agent SARS-CoV. An understanding of transmission patterns and the ability to diagnose and confirm affected patients ultimately led to effective containment measures and a slowdown in the spread of the disease. Due to the lack of medications or a vaccine, the options for early intervention were limited to public health measures [

      The steps that led to the containment of SARS can be illustrated by the events that occurred in Beijing. Beijing experienced the largest outbreak of SARS beginning on the March 5, 2003. The outbreak peaked within 6 weeks on the April 25, 2003 when 173 newly suspected SARS cases were hospitalized daily [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">
       46
      </xref>
      ]. On the June 20, 2003, the last batch of 18 SARS patients recovered and were discharged from hospital, signaling the end of the pandemic in Beijing. The prompt resolution of the outbreak in Beijing was attributed to the rapid adoption of a series of effective control measures.

       After SARS, development of a vaccine appeared to be the best approach to prevent future SARS-CoV epidemics. However, there were many obstacles in SARS vaccine development. Firstly, researchers did not have a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV. Secondly, animal models of SARS-CoV infection could not simulate human disease because of an incongruent pathogenesis. Thirdly, in order to test the efficacy, many people must be tested in areas where the virus is endemic. Once the SARS epidemic ended, human trials were not possible [

       On the January 22, 2020, a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia reported that he was infected by SARS-CoV-2 during an inspection in Wuhan. He had worn an N95 mask but did not wear eye protection. Several days before the onset of pneumonia, he complained of redness of the eyes.

Of the 15 pediatric cases, 13 had a clear history of family clustering in Wuhan. At present, several confirmed pregnant women in Wuhan have given birth during the illness. On February 2, 2020, Wuhan local media reported that a confirmed pregnant woman gave birth to a newborn by cesarean section under strict level three protection, but the newborn's throat swab was positive for the nucleic acid virus test [

       ]. However, Chen et al. tested the SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women, and all samples tested negative for the virus, which suggests that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy [

       The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team of the Chinese CDC reported the epidemiology characteristics of 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, 2020. Among the confirmed 44,672 cases (74.7% in Hubei Province), 51.4% were male, and 80.9% were mild or moderate cases. The majority of the cases were between 30 and 69 years old (77.8%), while 0-9 year-olds and 10-19 year-olds accounted for 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. Hypertension (12.8%), diabetes (5.3%), cardiovascular disease (4.2%) were the most common underlying diseases. A total of 1023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%, and 81% of the deaths were over 60 years old. The mortality rates of those aged 60–69, 70–79 and over 80 years were 3.6%, 8.0%, and 14.8%, respectively. The mortality rate of critical cases was 49% [

       Based on this evidence, the current SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible in humans, even in children and pregnant women. It should also be noted that most patients have a good prognosis. The symptoms in children are relatively mild, and only a minority are in critical condition. The death cases involved mostly the elderly and those with a chronic underlying disease. This fact, however, does not diminish the seriousness of the epidemic.

Some patients only have a low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties occurring more than one week after infection. Critical patients may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even death.

In Guan's study, 840 of 1099 patients received chest CT on admission which showed that 76.4% had pneumonia, but 23.9% of severe cases had no radiologic abnormality on initial presentation. Ground-glass opacity (50.0%) and bilateral patchy shadow (46.0%) were the most common findings [

      The earliest cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified as “pneumonia of unknown etiology”, which was defined as an illness of unknown etiology with 1. Fever with or without a recorded temperature 2. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia 3. Low or normal leukocyte count or low lymphocyte count during the early stage of disease and 4. No improvement or worsening symptoms after 3–5 days of antimicrobial treatment per standard clinical guidelines [

However, because of a shortage of diagnostic reagents for SARS-CoV-2 detection, different guidelines or programs emphasized comprehensive analysis based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and imaging examinations in diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis also includes non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia. It should be noted that often patients with viral pneumonia may test positive to multiple viruses, and the potential lethality of a combined SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus infection should not be ignored.

      The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnosis in preventing spread of disease

     <p id="p0315">
      Several rapid and sensitive detection tests have been developed for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. At present, seven products including the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit (fluorescent PCR method) and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequencing system have been approved on an emergency basis by the National Medical Products Administration. Biological product companies have expanded production of detection kits for the new coronavirus. The use of detection kits can accelerate accurate diagnosis of patients, help to determine quarantine and isolation requirements, assist in determining the treatment of patients and save limited medical resources. However, the rapidity of spread of the disease has led to an insufficient supply of detection kits.
     </p>
     <p id="p0320">
      It is worth noting that there have been confirmed patients whose viral nucleic acid tests are negative multiple times in the early stages, and there have also been confirmed cases whose throat swabs were negative for the viral nucleic acid test but positive in alveolar lavage fluid. Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR testing of 1014 cases showed that CT had a 88% had a positive CT scan but only 59% had positive RT-PCR. [

      ]. The poor sensitivity of the current tests makes diagnosis and epidemic control more challenging. Sampling techniques, extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids, and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results. More attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents, and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients. According to the latest guideline of the NHC [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">

HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are sometimes attributed to the “common cold”, but in rare cases can cause severe infections in infants, young children and elderly people. On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect the lower respiratory tract and cause a severe respiratory syndrome in human [

      The term “cell pyroptosis” was first proposed in 2001 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">
       88
      </xref>
      ]. In recent decades, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that “pyroptosis” is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death. In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">
       89
      </xref>
      ]. Studies have shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased IL-1β in the serum [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">
       26
      </xref>

As the rise of IL-1β is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and non-classical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1β, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The pathways involved in the activation of the signaling between NLRP3m IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD are illustrated in

A team of professionals from the NHC and China CDC was sent to conduct field investigations and implement disease control and prevention measures. The virus was quickly isolated and sequenced. On January 3, 2020, the first complete genome of the SARS-CoV-2 was determined and shared internationally, which led to the rapid development and deployment of diagnostic tests [

       Quarantine is a traditional but very effective measure to counter a deadly epidemic, but quarantine protocols can be hard to enforce. The local government in Wuhan announced the suspension of public transportation, with closure of airports, railway stations, and highways in the city, to prevent further disease transmission on January 23, 2020. Subsequently, the Chinese government imposed travel bans on several Chinese cities near Wuhan. At the same time, the Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holidays and postponed the reopening of schools and factories to keep the nationwide migration of the population to a minimum. Travelers from Wuhan and other epidemic areas were advised to report their travel history and to self-quarantine for two weeks to prevent community transmission. In addition, most local governments required that all passengers must wear medical surgical masks or N95 masks when accessing public places, taxis or subways. Temperature screening checkpoints have been set up at subway stations, railway stations, high-speed rail exits and airports to screen passengers in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

On January 24, 2020, the local government in Wuhan announced the construction of a 1000-bed infirmary, named Huoshenshan hospital, and a 1500-bed infirmary, named Leishenshan hospital within 10 days, to ease the shortage of beds and treat people diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2. These facilities are specialty hospitals for infectious diseases, rather than simply units to receive and quarantine patients. Wuhan has also been building 11 mobile Fangcang hospitals (a Chinese name which came from Noah's Ark) and creating tens of thousands of beds, to centralize quarantine and provide medical treatment for confirmed patients with mild symptoms, suspected patients and those who need observation. The new facilities further enhance the local public health capacities. Hospitals offer online consultants and medical services to symptomatic patients and suspected patients, which help reduce the frequency that patients go to hospitals and thereby reduce the risk of being infected. Health care workers, including military medical teams, from across the Chinese mainland arrived in Hubei to provide much needed assistance. At present, more than 30,000 health care workers have arrived in Hubei to help fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. In order to prevent health care workers from being infected, the NHC ensured enough supplies of isolation gowns, gloves and masks and issued a technical guideline for the prevention and control of infection caused by the novel coronavirus [

      There is no clear, unified and effective treatment plan for COVID-19. Most guidelines emphasize early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis, and early treatment. The treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia mainly include the following aspects (

      Development of vaccines for coronavirus

     <p id="p0470">
      Research institutions and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are stepping up research and development for a coronavirus vaccine. Virus strains have been isolated from patients’ samples and provide the basis for research and development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Although vaccines have been developed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, these are not commercially available [

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines. However, the difficulties and challenges of developing an effective vaccine have been discussed earlier, and the key to a successful vaccine program is to vaccinate people before an outbreak occurs, not begin to develop the vaccine during the outbreak. Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines.

Early recognition of the problem, early identification of infected patients and early mobilization of healthcare resources are critical in limiting morbidity and mortality. When an outbreak occurs, it is very important to rapidly identify and characterize the pathogen, in order to be able to develop diagnostic assays. In the early stage of the disease epidemic, summarizing the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy, formulating the diagnosis procedures, defining suspected cases and locations, determining transmission patterns, isolating contagious patients and formulating the appropriate quarantine strategy are all necessary and need to be implemented promptly.

      The strict control of cross-infection in medical institutions is also key to preventing the further spread of the epidemic. In addition, actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical, and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates. Real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety. A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. Last but not least, use of the Internet and the media to conduct health education for the people, publicize the correct knowledge of prevention, and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containment.

      <p id="p0485">
       Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological characteristics, there are some important differences. First, the most fundamental difference between the two viruses lies in their gene sequence. Second, during the SARS epidemic, a total of 8422 patients worldwide were infected with SARS-CoV, of whom 919 died, with a mortality rate of 9.5% [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">

       </xref>
       ]. As of February 17, 2020, there were 72,436 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in China, of whom 1868 have died, with a mortality rate of 2.6% [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">

       From 2017 to 2018, influenza ravaged the world, affecting up to 45 million people and killing about 95,000 people, with a reported mortality rate of about 0.2%. Every year millions of people are infected by influenza despite the existence of a yearly vaccine. According to the United States CDC weekly report, the number of childhood deaths in the United States so far from influenza during this flu season alone is 105. Compared with influenza, the number of patients who have died of coronavirus infection is less, but the virulence and mortality rate of coronavirus is significantly higher.

       Clinically, the patients with COVID-19 have no upper respiratory symptoms (such as runny nose, sneezing, sore throat). In 2003, a large number of medical personnel were infected, and iatrogenic transmission occurred in SARS. In contrast, although there are cases of nosocomial infection in SARS-CoV-2, most of them are out-of-hospital infections.

       What can we learn from the 2020 nCoV epidemic in China?
      </title>
      <p id="p0500">
       The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic of 2020 in China is an international crisis, affecting human lives, the global economy, societal views and lifestyle. During times of crisis, misinformation, blame and conspiracy theories abound. It is probably prudent to not entirely trust the media, whether local, regional or international, as each most likely has their own agenda. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of doctors and scientists to evaluate the events to ascertain whether or not more effective management of the crisis could have been attained. This comes with its own set of challenges, as hindsight is always 20/20.

       The quarantining of an entire country has been extreme, astounding and unprecedented. This not only involves quarantining measures within China but also internationally, as countries canceled flights into China, quarantined their own nationals as they returned from China and installed thermal scanners to detect ill people. But the quarantine measures inside China are certainly eye-opening. The entire city of Wuhan was shut off, and this was extended to every other city in China. In effect, the entire country was told to stay home, creating an enormous impact on the economy and on people's daily lives. Roads and stores became deserted (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">
        Fig. 10
       </xref>
       ). In Ningbo, each household was only permitted to send one person out for groceries every other day. Schools were closed till the end of March. Everyone wears masks. The objective was to starve the virus, to eliminate hosts. Yet even with these measures, new cases continued to appear. The quarantine measures in China have obviously come under a great deal of scrutiny, with so called “experts” weighing in, some saying that it will not work, that isolating a city deprives it of medical resources. Whatever the criticism, it is humbling to think of what may have happened without these draconian measures. It is also difficult to comprehend if such measures could actually take place in other parts of the world, or if the implementation of these changes could have taken place as quickly. For example, hand shaking is not part of Chinese culture, but it is almost automatic in other parts of the world, and it is normally done without even thinking. This is the first thing that would have to stop to help contain the virus.

       Then there is the matter of the ophthalmologist and others who voiced concerns in the media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like illness near the end of December. At the present time, it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was, as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing. It is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time. It is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic. Perhaps this was the wrong decision, but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess. It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated. The lesson here is that dissemination of accurate and validated information and establishing guidelines to prevent the spread of infections is critical.

       There are many “heroes” in these crises, people who have risked their lives and made incredible sacrifices to help society rid itself of this scourge, including those who work on the front lines, epidemiologists, scientists, doctors, first responders, and members of the public. Unfortunately, these events also bring out the worst in people. Numerous accounts of racial discrimination have been perpetrated against Asians across the world, many rising to the level of hate crimes. One must not forget the psychological impact of an infection such as this on people who are not even infected or who will never encounter an infected person.

       The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2, suggests that coronavirus will pose a lasting threat to human beings. The epidemic will eventually be contained, and people's memory of the coronavirus may gradually blur. But we must not forget the lessons learned from this crisis, and already begin to take measures to prevent the next new outbreak of Coronavirus or some other virus from appearing in the future. If it does appear, how will we respond to it? What if it does not happen in China? Will other countries have the fortitude to implement even more drastic measures and mobilize resources to prevent the spread of the virus and to care for the sick?

       We can always improve on the handling of global pandemics or epidemics. From the lessons learned during the SARS and now the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, we can nearly provide a roadmap for the response to future outbreaks. The development of a vaccine for coronavirus is a critical step in prevention, but it may not be effective for future strains, and we must be ready for the next epidemic.

        A maximum clade credibility tree constructed using the full-length spike (S) and hemagglutinin-esterase genes revealed that Vietnamese Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains belong to a single cluster (C1); therefore, they might share a common origin with Cuban and Chinese BCoV strains. The omega values of cluster 1 (C1) and cluster 2 (C2) were 0.15734 and 0.11613, respectively, and naive empirical bayes analysis identified two amino acid positions (179 and 501) in the S protein in C1 and three amino acid positions (113, 501, and 525) in that of C2 that underwent positive selection (

        substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of Vietnamese BCoVs was estimated to date back to 1962 (95% HPD 1950–1973). The effective population sizes of C1 and C2 underwent a rapid reduction after 2000 and 2004, respectively.

     Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was first identified during an outbreak of diarrhea among neonatal calves in the 1970s [

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">

     To date, BCoV infection has been reported in calves and adult cattle in many cattle-producing countries. In Vietnam, it has been reported that ELISA was applied to investigate the calf diarrhea in the Hue city and resulted that Bovine rotavirus and BCoV-positives of samples were 37.7% and 33.3%, respectively [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">

All cows were aged between 0.5 and 72 months and had diarrhea. BCoV-positive feces were diagnosed using a Rapid BoviD-5 antigen kit (BioNote Inc., Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and PCR analysis using previously described primer sets [

     ) according to ESS (4448.7229). The tMRCA on the MCC tree of BCoV HE gene suggests that C1 and C3 diverged 41.3604 years ago (95% HPD 35.6184–47.4545) and 63.4262 years ago (95% HPD 55.8045–71.4806), respectively (data not shown).

     The effective population size for the BCoV C1 cluster estimated by Bayesian skyline analysis fell sharply at three separate times. The first fall was from 196.7854 (95% HPD 403.4424–72.53619) in 2000 to 92.57811 (95% HPD 199.8897–36.79424) in 2002. The second fall was from 82.83793 (95% HPD 176.1481–30.70227) in 2007 to 24.81323 (95% HPD 81.35125–4.641601) in 2008. Finally, the third fall was from 21.73334 (95% HPD 75.96825–3.794129) in 2015 to 11.40183 (95% HPD 38.80617–1.621968) in 2017 (Fig.

     b). The effective population size for the BCoV C2 cluster fell once, from 201.6739 (95% HPD 400.4581–74.48877) in 2004 to 13.38442 (95% HPD 47.3822–2.208484) in 2014 (Fig.

     In conclusion, Vietnam BCoV sequences might share a common ancestor with the Cuban and Chinese BCoV strains [high nucleotide sequence similarity within the same cluster, (C1)]. Molecular clock analysis of S gene sequences estimated that the time of divergence from a common ancestor of C1 and C2 was estimated to be 1962. The effective population sizes for the BCoV C1 and C2 clusters fell rapidly from 2000 to 2004, respectively.

        As a World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint priority pathogen, there is a need to better understand the geographic distribution of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its potential to infect mammals and humans. This database documents cases of MERS-CoV globally, with specific attention paid to zoonotic transmission. An initial literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; after screening articles according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 208 sources were selected for extraction and geo-positioning. Each MERS-CoV occurrence was assigned one of the following classifications based upon published contextual information: index, unspecified, secondary, mammal, environmental, or imported. In total, this database is comprised of 861 unique geo-positioned MERS-CoV occurrences. The purpose of this article is to share a collated MERS-CoV database and extraction protocol that can be utilized in future mapping efforts for both MERS-CoV and other infectious diseases. More broadly, it may also provide useful data for the development of targeted MERS-CoV surveillance, which would prove invaluable in preventing future zoonotic spillover.

This database seeks fill gaps in literature and build upon existing notification data by enhancing the geographic resolution of MERS-CoV data and providing occurrences of both mammal and environmental detections in addition to human cases. This information can help inform epidemiological models and targeted disease surveillance, both of which play important roles in strengthening global health security. Knowledge of the geographic extent of disease transmission allows stakeholders to develop appropriate emergency response and preparedness activities (

       We identified published reports of MERS-CoV by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with the following terms: “Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome”, “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome”, “MERSCoV”, and “MERS”. The initial search was for all articles published about MERS-CoV prior to April 30, 2017, and was subsequently updated to February 22, 2018. These searches were conducted through the University of Washington Libraries’ institutional database subscriptions. We searched the Web of Science Web of Science Core Collection (the subscribed edition includes Science Citation Index Expanded, 1900-present; Social Sciences Citation Index, 1975-present; Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index, 1975-present; Emerging Sources Citation Index, 2015-present). We searched the standard Scopus database and the standard, freely available PubMed database; these products have a single version that is consistent across institutional subscriptions or access points.

Non-English articles were flagged for further review and brought into the full text screening stage.

       Full text review was conducted on 1,083 sources. To meet the inclusion criteria, articles must have contained both of the following items: 1) a detection of MERS-CoV from humans, animals, or environmental sources, and 2) MERS-CoV occurrences tagged with spatial information. Additionally, extractors attempted to prospectively manually remove articles containing duplicate occurrences that were already extracted in the dataset. Extractors only prospectively manually removed articles if it was clear the articles contained data we were confident had already been extracted and had high-quality data. We excluded 885 sources based on full text review. In addition, we reviewed citations and retroactively added relevant articles to our database if they were not already included. We retroactively added and subsequently marked ten articles for extraction using this process. In total, we extracted 208 peer-reviewed sources reporting detection of MERS-CoV that included geographic and relevant epidemiological metadata.

       was used to manually extract location information at the highest resolution available from individual articles. We evaluated spatial information as either points or polygons. The geography was defined as a point if the location of transmission was reported to have occurred within a 5 × 5 km area. Point data are represented by a specific latitude and longitude. A point references an area smaller than 5 × 5 km in order to be compatible with the typical 5 × 5 km resolution of satellite imagery used for global analyses.

       The geography was defined as a polygon if the location of transmission was less clear, but known to have occurred in a general area (e.g. a province), or the location of transmission occurred within an area greater than 5 × 5 km (e.g. a large city). We used contextual information to determine location in instances where the author’s spelling of a location differed from Google Maps or ArcGIS. Maps provided by authors were digitized using ArcGIS.

       We used three different types of polygons: known administrative boundaries, buffers, and custom polygons. Relevant administrative units were sourced from the Global Administrative Unit Layers curated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN

       for known administrative boundaries of governorates, districts, or regions, and paired with the occurrence record. Buffers were created to encompass areas in cities and regions without corresponding administrative units. To ensure that buffers encompassed the entirety of the area of interest, Google Maps was used to determine the required radius. In areas with unspecified boundaries (e.g. Table Mountain National Park and the border region between Saudi Arabia and UAE) ArcGIS was used to generate custom polygons, which were assigned a unique code within a defined shapefile for ease of re-identification.

      An important consideration, whether using the literature data alone, or in combination with other databases, is the potential for duplication. Various pieces of metadata can be used to evaluate where potential duplicates could lie, such as common date fields (month_start, month_end, year_start, year_end) or consistent geographic details (lat, long, poly_id, shape_type) or shared epidemiological tags (patient_type). Researchers may wish to consider further steps, such as fuzzy matching of geographic data (e.g. matching a point with an overlapping buffer) or temporal data (e.g. matching a precise month with an overlapping month interval). We acknowledge this duplicate-removal process will not catch all matching records, but it will likely catch several. We recommend this approach because it will allow researchers to remove several duplicates without erroneously deleting any two occurrences that are truly unique (i.e. not duplicates). Essentially, we recommend a sensitive approach above a more specific approach, as the latter simply risks culling too many records that aren’t actually duplicates.

      for instance, nomenclature for case definitions is slightly different, with WHO definitions of “Community Acquired” and “Not Reported” comparable to “Index” and “Unspecified” respectively. In addition, it is important to recognize what information is beyond the scope of these additional databases. Again, when comparing to the WHO dataset, it is important to recognize that serologically positive cases do not meet the case definition used in the WHO database. These adjustments need to be identified on a dataset-to-dataset basis.

      The addition of sampling techniques and prevalence data may improve this dataset. Researchers were ultimately unable to add these data due to inconsistencies in the way literature reported sampling techniques and prevalence date by geography. An attempt to extract these data using the current approach would have led to sporadic inclusion of this information and would not have been comprehensive for the entire dataset. Moving forward, we recommend authors report sampling technique and prevalence data at the highest resolution geography possible, as seen in Miguel

      This database may also be utilized in clinical settings to provide an evidence-base for diagnoses when used in conjunction with patient travel histories. Additionally, it can be used to identify geographies for surveillance, particularly areas where MERS-CoV has been documented in animals but not humans (e.g. Ethiopia and Nigeria). Identifying locations for surveillance will, in turn, inform global health security. While models will increase the resolution at which these questions can be addressed, datasets such as this provide an initial baseline.

      A major limitation of this database is the potential for sampling bias, which stems from higher frequency of disease reporting within countries where there exists strong healthcare infrastructure and reporting systems. This database does not attempt to account for such biases, which must be addressed in subsequent modelling activities where such biases are of consequence. Similarly, another limitation is potential duplicate documentation of singular occurrences. This can happen when the same occurrence is assigned different geographies (e.g. point, polygon) in multiple publications. Even though extractors made efforts to prospectively manually identify duplicate occurrences, this was challenging because the process relied upon papers providing sufficient details for extractors to determine a duplicate occurrence (e.g. geography, patient demographics, dates of occurrence, diagnostic methods, etc.). However, the majority of papers did not report such details for each occurrence. In those instances, it was impossible for extractors to discern whether occurrences may have been duplicates from a previous artic le. Even case studies inconsistently reported patient details and demographic information. These are some examples of challenges faced by extractors when we attempted to identify duplicates. Without sufficient contextual clues, extractors lacked evidence to determine duplicity and thus likely extracted some unique occurrences more than once. Despite efforts to remove duplicate occurrences from the database, it is possible that some remain.
     </p>
     <p id="Par83">
      Geographic uncertainty is similarly problematic for analyses such as this. In some cases, polygons, as opposed to points, are utilised as a geographic frame of reference, reflecting the uncertainty in geotagging in the articles themselves. For some occurrences, there is a strong assumption that the geography listed corresponds to the site of infection. While the use of 5 km × 5 km as the minimum geographical unit allows for some leeway in this precision, it is possible that even with the point data (often corresponding to household clusters) these may not map directly with true infection sites. This must be considered in any subsequent geospatial analysis.

      Finally, this database represents a time-bounded survey of the literature. While all efforts were made to be comprehensive within this period, articles, and therefore data, will continue to be published. Efforts to streamline ongoing collection processes are still to be fully realized

         There is global health concern that the mass movement of pilgrims to and from Mecca annually could contribute to the international spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In China, about 11,000 Muslim pilgrims participate in the Hajj gathering in Mecca annually. This is the first report of MERS-CoV and respiratory virus molecular screening of returning pilgrims at points of entry in China from 2013 to 2015.

        <p id="Par2">
         A total of 847 returning Hajj pilgrims participated in this study. The test results indicated that of the travelers, 34 tested positive for influenza A virus, 14 for influenza B virus, 4 for metapneumo virus, 2 for respiratory syncytial virus, and 3 for human coronavirus. There was a significant difference in the rates of positive and negative influenza virus tests between Hajj pilgrims with symptoms and those without. The detection rates of influenza virus were not significantly different among the three years studied, at 5.3, 6.0 and 6.3% for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

      The participants in this study were adult Hajj pilgrims who traveled in groups to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and stayed there for 35–40 days from September to October, 2013–2015. In China, the government arranged charter flights for Hajj pilgrims to visit Mecca. Infectious disease monitoring and surveillance of foreigners travelers coming from other countries is the responsibility of AQSIQ (General Administration Quality Supervision Inspection and Quarantine of the People’s Republic of China). AQSIQ supervises 283 entry–exit ports in China, and operates on behalf of the national government. For all Chinese Hajj pilgrims, personal and flight information was recorded and a medical examination was conducted, including vaccination by a local AQSIQ office, before the trip to Mecca. Xinjiang and Gansu Province have the highest number of Hajj pilgrims visiting Mecca each year. In this study, our institute, the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, cooperated with the Xinjiang and Gansu Entry–Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau. We randomly selected 847 returning pilgrims arriving at Xinjiang and Gansu airports, and asked for their consent to participate in this study. In China, every entry–exit airport has an infrared radiation thermometer, installed by AQSIQ, to screen travelers’ body temperatures. Among 847 returning pilgrims, 20 returning pilgrims triggered the alarm on passing through the infrared radiation thermometer installed at the airport to monitor travelers’ body temperature. Sixteen of these travelers were confirmed by using a clinical thermometer to have the onset of fever (&gt;37.5 °C), and also reported a sore throat or cough on the returning flight. The remaining 831 returning pilgrims did not have a fever or other symptoms. The numbers of travelers with fever in each year were 7 (2013), 4 (2014), and 5 (2015). The mean age of all participants was 62.24 years old (SD = 6.19). In this study, 351 were females and 496 were males, and they were all Moslem. All pilgrims were asked to undergo a health examination and were vaccinated against influenza A and B in a local travel health center a week prior to departure. All participants included in this study were voluntary and signed consent forms.

      For the detection of viral infection, samples included lower respiratory tract sputum, washes, and upper respiratory tract oropharyngeal swab specimens. Lower respiratory tract sputum samples were used to test for respiratory viruses during this 3-year period. All pilgrims were tested for influenza and MERS, but only those with fever were tested for the other viruses. All specimens were collected immediately when returning pilgrims arrived at each point of entry, and nucleic acid was isolated and immediately screened by real time RT-PCR for the

      All real time RT-PCR results for MERS-CoV were negative. A total of 34 influenza A and 14 influenza B virus positive samples were detected from 2013 to 2015 (Table

      ). Of these, the test results from participants with a fever indicated that 7 samples were positive for influenza A, 4 were hMPV positive, 2 were hRSV positive, and 1 participant was positive for each of HKU1, 229E, and OC43. In addition, 27 influenza A and 14 influenza B positive samples were detected from non-symptomatic travelers. No dual infections were detected. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) There is a significant difference in the positive and negative rates of influenza virus detection between Hajj pilgrims with symptoms and those without. Pearson’s Chi-square analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the influenza virus detection rates between travelers with fever and those without symptoms (χ

(2) There is a significant difference in the rates of influenza (A and B) virus detection among the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The rates of influenza virus detection for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were 5.3, 6.0, and 6.3%, respectively, and statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the rates of influenza virus detection among these three years (χ

      Discussion

     <p id="Par8">
      In this study, we did not detect any cases of MERS-CoV infection but respiratory virus infections including influenza A and B, hMPV, hRSV, and human coronavirus were detected among Hajj pilgrims returning to China. This result was consistent with the outcomes of similar studies of respiratory virus detection in Hajj pilgrims in France, North India, Egypt, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and the UK [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
       12

      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">

      </xref>
      ]. Regarding the detection of influenza viruses, these studies reported detection rates of 7.8% in France (no vaccination) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">
       15
      </xref>
      ], 11% in North India (72% vaccination rate) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">
       14
      </xref>
      ], 14% in Egypt (20% vaccination rate) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
       13
      </xref>
      ], 1.3% in Ghana (vaccination rate unknown) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
       5
      </xref>
      ], and 7% in the UK (37% vaccination rate) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">
       17
      </xref>
      ]. In our study, all participants had been vaccinated against influenza virus, but 5.7% tested positive for influenza virus infection. We are unable to measure the direct impact of influenza vaccination on the resistance of Hajj pilgrims to influenza infection and further studies are required to understand the efficacy of the influenza vaccine among this population. However, increasing the rate of vaccination will help protect individuals, particularly those travelers that are most vulnerable to infection such as older adults and those that may be immunocompromised. A combination of vaccination and rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals currently offer the best strategy for the prevention and treatment of infections among Hajj pilgrims.

      In this study, MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the upper respiratory swabs or sputum specimens tested. However, limiting the time taken for sample collection, the type of samples collected and the selection of participants can all affect the rates of positive detection. In previous studies, most samples were nasal swabs collected from strongly suspected symptomatic participants after they were under investigation in hospital [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
       13
      </xref>
      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">
       17
      </xref>
      ]. However, in our study, swabs were collected from both suspected and asymptomatic returning pilgrims immediately after their arrival at airports. Our sampling design would therefore include some healthy pilgrims, thereby decreasing the rate of detection of respiratory virus infections. In addition, upper respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum) have been demonstrated to have a lower MERS-CoV genome load than lower respiratory specimens such as tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
       18
      </xref>
      ]. This may also have limited the detection of MERS-CoV in our study.

      Conclusions
     </title>
     <p id="Par10">
      The findings from our study demonstrate the risk of influenza infection among travelers during mass gatherings, and confirming the need for effective surveillance of imported infectious diseases at entry points into China. The Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of different infectious disease preventive and detective measures that require a large sample size. Continued annual monitoring of MERS-CoV, influenza viruses, and other respiratory viruses (such as human rhinovirus), is needed to increase our understanding of the epidemic patterns of respiratory virus infections among Hajj pilgrims in China.

         Introduction
        </bold>
        : The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

         Areas covered
        </bold>
        : The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed.

         Expert opinion
        </bold>
        : Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.

      Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2002–2004 [

      <xref rid="CIT0003">
       3
      </xref>
      ]) in the last two decades are a significant threat to global public health. SARS and MERS represent a new class of public health concern that may continue to emerge into human populations: respiratory syndromes caused by coronaviruses (CoVs) that are transmitted from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Although SARS and MERS initially present as mild, influenza-like illnesses with fever, dyspnea, and cough, progression to more severe symptoms is characterized by an atypical interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are capable of causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury where alveolar inflammation, pneumonia, and hypoxic lung conditions lead to respiratory failure, multiple organ disease, and death in 50% of ARDS patients [
      <xref rid="CIT0004">
       4
      </xref>
      ]. The total confirmed number of patients infected with highly pathogenic CoVs is relatively low (approximately 10,000 cases of both SARS and MERS since 2002), but CoVs are of particular concern due to high case fatality rates, lack of proven therapeutics, as well as the demonstrated ability of these pathogens to seed outbreaks that rapidly cross geographic and geopolitical borders into other countries and continents [

       Highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV recently emerged into human populations, but other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are estimated to have circulated in human populations for hundreds of years, causing mild respiratory illness to which approximately 5–30% of ‘common colds’ are attributed [

       ]. Within the
       <italic>
        Coronaviridae
       </italic>
       family (order Nidovirales) four genera are recognized: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. The six HCoVs (
       <xref rid="T0001">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ) currently identified belong to the genera alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have no known viruses that infect humans, but contain important agricultural pathogens of livestock. Epizootic coronaviruses in animals cause a wide range of disease signs resulting from respiratory, enteric, and neurological tissue tropism. Although HCoVs cause primarily respiratory symptoms, the potential for a wide range of severe disease symptoms in humans caused by infection by future emergent coronaviruses cannot be excluded. Despite the severity and diversity of coronavirus disease signs and symptoms affecting a large number of important livestock species as well as humans, there are no proven therapies that specifically target CoVs.

       In addition to CoVs known to cause disease in humans and livestock, a large number of highly diverse coronaviruses have been identified based on sequences collected from sampling bat species. Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) sequences recovered from sampling sites on different continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, North America) over the last decade contain putative BatCoVs from diverse branches of the betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus phylogenetic tree [

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0012">
        12
       </xref>
       ]. Importantly, the two coronaviruses that cause the most severe disease in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged from BatCoVs that were not previously recognized to infect humans or animals other than bats [
       <xref rid="CIT0012">

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0014">
        14
       </xref>
       ]. Recent studies suggest that BatCoV-SHC014 and BatCoV-WIV1 are genetically similar to SARS-CoV and enter cells using human receptors [

       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0016">
        16
       </xref>
       ]. Similarly, BatCoV-HKU4 and BatCoV-HKU5 are MERS-like BatCoVs that may also be circulating in bat populations, and some MERS-like BatCoVs may also be able to recognize human host cell receptors [
       <xref rid="CIT0017">

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0019">
        19
       </xref>
       ]. Such BatCoVs are now called ‘pre-emergent’, because they may have the potential to emerge into human populations. Importantly, therapeutics that rely on host memory responses to target CoV infection are often not effective against pre-emergent BatCoVs that differ antigenically from known HCoVs, highlighting the need for pan-coronavirus therapeutics that target conserved mechanisms utilized by HCoVs and BatCoVs [

       SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV likely evolved from BatCoVs that infected other intermediate host animals in closer proximity to humans, resulting in SARS and MERS outbreaks (

          Emergence of coronaviruses into human populations, including highly pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, has occurred by spillover from bat reservoir hosts into intermediate hosts. The intermediate hosts during the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic included civets and other small carnivore species located in wet animal markets. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedary camels, and is particularly associated with active infection of juvenile camels. Novel emerging CoVs may occur in the future via infection from bat populations into other intermediate animal hosts. Additional evidence from BatCoVs indicates that pre-emergent CoVs with the ability to directly infect human cells may be poised for emergence into human populations. Based on prior research from SARS and MERS outbreaks, animal workers that have contact with intermediate animal host species and health-care workers that are exposed to nosocomial CoV infections are at increased risk of highly pathogenic coronavirus transmission. More severe disease in SARS and MERS cases resulted in patients that were over the age of 65 or had comorbidities such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, renal disease, or hypertension.

       Epidemiological features of CoV outbreaks
      </title>
      <p>
       Research on coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has focused primarily on highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to the major potential consequences of pandemics resulting from these pathogens. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not transmit as efficiently from person-to-person compared to other respiratory pathogens like seasonal influenza, but mortality in patients of SARS (approximately 10%) and MERS (approximately 35%) greatly exceeded typical seasonal influenza case-fatality rates (2.4 deaths per 100,000 cases) [
       <xref rid="CIT0024">
        24
       </xref>
       ]. Air travel facilitated these CoVs in seeding outbreaks in regions distant from initial localized viral spread: SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of southeastern China in late 2002, and then spread rapidly to other parts of the world, with outbreaks in major cities including Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto, resulting in one of the first pandemics of the twenty-first century [
       <xref rid="CIT0005">
        5
       </xref>
       ]. Since MERS-CoV emerged in 2012, MERS cases have been exported from the Middle East to Europe, North America, Africa, and South East Asia, including a major outbreak of 186 people in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [
       <xref rid="CIT0025">
        25
       </xref>
       ]. Superspreaders (individuals that transmit SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV to a large number of people) played an important role in initiating and perpetuating CoV outbreaks: the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea started from a single traveler case, and just five cases were responsible for more than 80% of the transmission events [
       <xref rid="CIT0025">
        25
       </xref>
       ]. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted by close contact, with known outbreaks occurring in hotels, apartment buildings, and hospitals or health-care centers. Health-care workers, in particular, were at risk for infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at high rates [
       <xref rid="CIT0005">
        5
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0026">
        26
       </xref>
       ]. In addition, animal workers were more likely to come into contact with CoV infected animals, and a large percentage of MERS patients had contact with intermediate host camels [
       <xref rid="CIT0026">
        26
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0027">
        27
       </xref>
       ]. Analysis of severe SARS or MERS disease identified disproportionately high case-fatality rates in elderly patients (age &gt; 65 years) and patients with pre-existing comorbidities including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and renal disease [
       <xref rid="CIT0004">

       ]. Based on these epidemiological considerations, pan-coronavirus therapeutics are needed to i) protect populations with occupational risk for transmission of CoVs, ii) protect populations with susceptibility to severe disease from CoVs, iii) work in concert with public health measures like quarantine and contact tracing, and iv) be rapidly deployable to geographically distant regions from local HCoV epidemics.

       Reverse genetics systems
      </title>
      <p>
       Advances in the study of highly pathogenic coronaviruses and potential pan-coronavirus drug candidates partially depend on the technology to genetically manipulate CoVs to probe mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and antiviral drug activity. Reverse genetics systems synthetically generate viruses from known viral sequences [
       <xref rid="CIT0029">
        29
       </xref>
       ]. In situations where clinical isolates of infectious material are unavailable due to restriction for collecting patient samples, shipping infectious materials, or availability of containment laboratories, reverse genetics systems provide essential research materials for studies on viral pathogenesis and model development. Prior to the SARS pandemic, robust reverse genetics systems to manipulate the genomes of CoVs had already been developed by systematic assembly of cDNA cassettes into full-length infectious clones, allowing precise and targeted genetic manipulation of viral genes [
       <xref rid="CIT0030">
        30
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0031">
        31
       </xref>
       ]. Infectious clones allow the creation of near-homogenous viral stocks, whereas traditional viral stocks are prepared by amplification of infectious material in cell culture over many passages. Strategies to build reverse genetics systems were rapidly applied to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV within the first year of identification of these viruses [
       <xref rid="CIT0032">
        32
       </xref>
       ,

       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to reconstructing epidemic strains of CoVs, reverse genetic systems allow targeting of mutations to specific viral genes and assembly of viruses when infectious material is not available. As an example, the ability to isolate mutations in particular genes was applied to studies of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, while maintaining the isogenic background of the viral replicase and other structural proteins. Mutations from zoonotic, early, middle, and late epidemic strains of the SARS-CoV outbreak were inserted into the S glycoprotein of the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani) to determine the effect of evolution on viral entry into human cells as well as viral pathogenesis in rodent and primate models of disease [
       <xref rid="CIT0034">

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0036">
        36
       </xref>
       ]. By targeting mutations to a specific viral gene, reverse genetics systems allow researchers to probe cause-and-effect relationships of host pathogenic responses to viral genetic changes. In addition, reverse genetics techniques were utilized to study pre-emergent BatCoV strains: recombinant versions of BatCoV-HKU3, BatCoV-WIV1, and BatCoV-SHC014 (SARS-CoV-like), as well as BatCoV-HKU5 (MERS-CoV-like) viruses, were generated and used for

       models of emerging coronavirus disease [

       Cell-based systems

      <p>
       Like all other viruses, coronaviruses require host cell machinery to replicate their genomes, produce progeny virions, and cause disease. Cell lines require expression of the host cell receptor as well as expression of necessary proteases to facilitate viral entry, although additional host factors may also be important for infection. The S glycoprotein of coronaviruses, the main determinant of host cell attachment and viral entry, is not well conserved between HCoVs. Most human coronaviruses use different host cell receptors for viral entry, and may also require different host cell proteases that allow fusion of viral and cellular membranes (
       <xref rid="T0001">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ) [
       <xref rid="CIT0039">
        39
       </xref>
       ]. Although all known HCoVs have viral tropism targeted at the human respiratory tract, lung cell lines infected by a broad range of HCoVs have not been defined. A key feature of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that highly pathogenic coronaviruses grow to higher viral titer on a wider range of cell lines than the other mildly pathogenic coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 [
       <xref rid="CIT0040">

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0044">
        44
       </xref>
       ]. High throughput approaches to screen compound libraries for targeted activity against coronaviruses have been underdeveloped and limited in the number of viral strains used [
       <xref rid="CIT0045">

       –
       <xref rid="CIT0052">

       </xref>
       ]. Infection of panels of cell lines from various animal species with HCoVs and BatCoVs informs on the potential host range of the pathogen, and may help to identify susceptible mammalian host involved in viral spread. However, productive infection of cell lines does not always translate to recapitulation of pathogenesis in the same animal model that the cell lines are derived from, which may be due to receptor availability in live animals or other biological and immunological factors during infection.

       Infection of pseudostratified airway epithelium cultures from primary cells of the lung provides a cell culture model that simulates infection of cells in a more complex environment more closely resembling the human respiratory tract. Known as Human Airway Epithelia (HAE) or Normal Human Bronchial Epithelia (NHBE) cells, these cultures can be infected with all of the HCoVs identified thus far, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, providing a potential platform to screen novel CoVs for emergence into human populations [

       ]. However, several limitations are associated with HAEs including difficulty in collection due to the scarcity of donors and difficulty in maintenance because of limited capacity for cell divisions. HAEs may be sourced from donors with a preexisting disease state, which could influence viral pathogenesis. In addition, because of the genetic variability of donors, HAEs cultures often differ in expression levels of genes crucial to infectivity, including the various host receptors for HCoVs, which leads to high variability in the infectivity of these cultures. Importantly, these
       <italic>

       methods fail to capture more complex viral interactions that occur with an intact immune system including infiltration of proinflammatory cells that may promote and contribute to ARDS in the most severe forms of SARS and MERS. Organ-on-a-chip models in development may provide the next generation of

      screening methods, potential new pan-coronavirus drugs that successfully target HCoVs require additional evaluation in animal species that model viral infection on an organismal scale. Due to urgent public health need for effective treatments against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, development of animal models of CoV infection emphasized these pathogens [

      <xref rid="CIT0059">

      ]. Reproducible models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection in common laboratory animal species have utility not only in development and testing of pan-coronavirus drugs, but also in elucidating mechanisms of viral replication or disease pathogenesis. Desirable qualities for animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include recapitulation of severe disease symptoms seen in SARS and MERS patients, and lethality caused by fulminant viral infection of the lung as indicated by high viral titers, inflammatory infiltrates, and aberrant cell signaling programs. Although therapeutic efficacy against viral transmission is essential to disrupting SARS or MERS outbreaks, current animal model development has focused on disease resulting from relevant infection routes (i.e. intranasal) over directly developing models of CoVs transmission.

       Following the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003, small animal model development was initiated by inoculating animals with human epidemic isolates of SARS-CoV that replicated in mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and ferrets, but only ferrets exhibited disease signs resulting from infection (

       ]. Serial passage of SARS-CoV in the lungs of mice by multiple research groups resulted in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains that caused lethal lung disease in wild-type mouse intranasal (IN) infection models [

To evaluate pathogenesis of emergent viruses

       Unlike SARS-CoV, human clinical strains of MERS-CoV (
       <xref rid="T0003">
        Table 3
       </xref>
       ) did not replicate in mice, hamsters, or ferrets, and further studies of the host receptor identified critical amino acid residue differences between the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, in laboratory animal model species that prevented entry into cells compared to human DPP4 [
       <xref rid="CIT0070">
        70
       </xref>
       –
       <xref rid="CIT0072">
        72
       </xref>
       ]. MERS-CoV infection of rabbits resulted in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract, but no clinical disease signs that reflect more severe MERS-CoV disease symptoms were reported, although the model has been used for limited testing of MERS-CoV antiviral therapeutics [
       <xref rid="CIT0073">

       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0074">
        74
       </xref>
       ]. However, due to the utility of the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model, a mouse model continued to be pursued, and adenovirus-vectored transient expression of the human DPP4 receptor in mice and subsequent replication of MERS-CoV in these mice determined that MERS-CoV replication was dependent on human DPP4 expression in rodents [
       <xref rid="CIT0075">
        75
       </xref>
       ]. Transgenic expression of human DPP4 in mice allowed MERS-CoV replication in mice, but resulted in lethal brain disease not representative of MERS-CoV infection in humans [
       <xref rid="CIT0076">
        76
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0077">
        77
       </xref>
       ]. Replacing mouse DPP4 with the expression of human DPP4 in mice resulted in a humanized DPP4 mouse model that allows MERS-CoV replication within the lung and some MERS-associated lung pathology, but no lethal disease [
       <xref rid="CIT0078">
        78
       </xref>
       ]. Similarly, knock-in expression of the human DPP4 exons 10–12 in mice allowed viral replication but no overt MERS disease signs [
       <xref rid="CIT0079">
        79
       </xref>
       ]. Serial passage of MERS-CoV in the lungs of these mice resulted in a MERS-MA virus that caused lethal disease in mice, including weight loss and severe lung pathology [
       <xref rid="CIT0079">
        79
       </xref>
       ]. Identification of amino acids in mouse DPP4 that prevent entry of MERS-CoV into mouse cells led to the rational design of the mouse DPP4 gene edited by CRISPR/Cas9 to express two human DPP4 mutations (288/330 DPP4) [
       <xref rid="CIT0080">
        80
       </xref>
       ]. 288/330 DPP4 mice supported viral replication without severe disease or lethality, but serial passage of MERS-CoV (generating a mouse-adapted virus called MERS-15) produced lethal disease in the 288/330 DPP4 mice [
       <xref rid="CIT0080">
        80
       </xref>
       ]. Although many of the same metrics of disease to MA15-SARS-CoV are available in the MERS-15 or MERS-MA models for drug discovery of coronavirus antivirals, an additional drawback is the requirement for both mouse-adapted virus and a modified rodent host. Despite these limitations, mouse models of adapted SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are currently the best-developed models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection available for pan-coronavirus drug discovery.

            MERS-CoV manifests in humans as a severe atypical pneumonia associated with diffuse alveolar damage. This is likely to include the deposition of alveolar exudates and formation of hyalin membranes in severe cases. Incubation period of MERS-CoV is 2–14 days. Initial symptoms may include fever and influenza-like illness followed by a progression to lower respiratory symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and pneumonia. MERS-CoV infection may lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury. Clinical MERS symptoms may occur for weeks following infection, including persistence of viral RNA in the lower respiratory tract. Healthcare workers and animal workers (particularly handlers of camels) are at increased occupational risk of exposure. Overall mortality rate for MERS-CoV in reported cases is approximately 30–40%, with more severe disease in patients over age 65 or with preexisting co-morbidities. Asymptomatic or subclinical MERS-CoV infection, particularly among healthy individuals may occur.

            Transient expression of the human DPP4 (hDPP4) receptor in mice by Ad5-hDPP4 allows vial replication in C57Bl6/J and BALB/c mice, but only minor clinical disease signs. Global constitutive expression of hDPP4 in transgenic mice results in lethal disease with minor lung pathology, but high viral replication in the CNS and lethal neuropathology not associated with human disease. Expression of hDPP4 in place of the mouse DPP4 ORF results in non-lethal disease characterized by viral replication and lung pathology.

            Editing of mouse DPP4 by CRISPR/Cas9 generated 288/330 hDPP4 mice resulting in viral replication in the lungs of mice. Serial passage of MERS-CoV 15 times in the lung of 288/330 hDPP4 mice resulted in MERS-15 virus that was lethal in about 40% of mice infected. Knock In (KI) expression of hDPP4 exons 10–12 in mice resulted in viral replication with no clinical disease signs following MERS-CoV infection. Serial passage of MERS-CoV 30 times in the lung of KI DPP4 mice resulted in a lethal mouse adapted strain, MERS-MA.

       Primate models for pan-coronavirus discovery
      </title>
      <p>
       Small animal models have been more thoroughly developed as models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, due to ease of manipulation with rodents and increased costs and ethical concerns associated with nonhuman primates (NHPs). However, NHP model development of highly pathogenic coronavirus infections is pivotal in the evaluation of pan-coronavirus therapeutics, because host immune responses from NHPs share greater homology with humans compared to rodents, and may more accurately indicate immunological biomarkers of severe disease needed to evaluate pan-coronavirus therapeutics. Disease signs are observed in NHP models of infection without adaptation of CoVs required in rodent models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV isolates from humans replicate in NHPs, indicating conservation of important aspects to coronavirus-induced diseases including respiratory tract biology, receptor homology, and pattern of expression of host receptor and proteases.
      </p>
      <p>
       SARS-CoV infection of common laboratory primate species by the IT route including African green monkeys, rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and common marmosets, resulted in disease signs with differing degrees of severity, but none were reflective of the lethal SARS disease seen in humans (
       <xref rid="T0002">
        Table 2
       </xref>
       ) [
       <xref rid="CIT0081">
        81
       </xref>
       –
       <xref rid="CIT0085">
        85
       </xref>
       ]. Commonly reported disease signs included lethargy and increased respiratory rates following SARS-CoV infection in multiple NHP models of infection, but other acute signs of illness including fever or dyspnea were infrequently reported. The most severe disease phenotypes were observed in the histopathology of the lungs at acute times post-infection (3–6 days) with typical findings of pulmonary lesions and pneumonitis and occasional observations of diffuse alveolar damage [
       <xref rid="CIT0086">
        86
       </xref>
       ]. Although none of the NHP species that were infected with SARS-CoV developed lethal respiratory disease reflective of SARS patients, NHP models did recapitulate enhanced disease in aged NHPs, including aberrant innate immune signaling programs [
       <xref rid="CIT0087">
        87
       </xref>
       ]. However, lack of emulation of human SARS disease was never resolved in an NHP model that could be used for consistent evaluation of therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV.
      </p>
      <p>
       MERS-CoV infection of nonhuman primate models was reported, with the best characterized NHP models of MERS-CoV infection in rhesus macaques and common marmosets (
       <xref rid="T0003">
        Table 3
       </xref>
       ) [
       <xref rid="CIT0088">
        88
       </xref>
       –
       <xref rid="CIT0091">
        91
       </xref>
       ]. Administering MERS-CoV via the IT route to either rhesus macaques or common marmosets resulted in mild disease with very few observable disease phenotypes [
       <xref rid="CIT0089">
        89
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0091">
        91
       </xref>
       ]. However, infecting rhesus macaques or common marmosets by multiple concurrent routes (IN, IT, oral, and ocular) resulted in moderate disease in rhesus macaques, but more severe disease in marmosets [
       <xref rid="CIT0088">
        88
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref rid="CIT0090">
        90
       </xref>
       ]. Infecting NHPs by multiple routes likely caused a systemic infection potentially not representative of human MERS-CoV infection. Although the marmoset is currently the best developed NHP model of MERS-CoV disease, discrepancies in disease severity of marmosets infected by multiple routes and marmosets infected by the IT route illuminate potential difficulties with using this model for drug development studies. Small size and fragility of marmosets precluded serial blood draws on multiple days following infection, and may confound experimental outcomes resulting from MERS-CoV infection or treatment [
       <xref rid="CIT0092">
        92
       </xref>
       ]. Absence of reproducible clinical disease signs like fever, respiratory distress, or lethality that recapitulated human symptoms of SARS or MERS indicates that currently developed models present significant challenges to testing of pan-coronavirus antivirals in NHP models of infection.

      Pan-coronavirus antivirals
     </title>
     <p>
      Pan-coronavirus antivirals must target viral or host factors that are i) highly conserved among known CoVs, ii) essential to viral replication or viral pathogenesis by known CoVs, and iii) likely to be conserved and essential in emerging CoVs. Inhibiting highly conserved mechanisms involved in the coronavirus lifecycle is likely to result in a reduction of viral titers, alteration of host responses, and/or amelioration of disease signs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known threats to global health, but other novel coronaviruses may emerge in the future complicating drug design if antiviral targets are too specific to known viral strains. Unlike with influenza viruses, specific antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir targeting coronaviruses are not yet available, but several promising candidates have been recently described in the literature. The most conserved proteins among CoVs are nonstructural proteins (nsps) involved in essential functions of the viral lifecycle. The structural proteins that make up the virion are less conserved than nsps, and accessory proteins are only functionally conserved among very closely related viruses (
      <xref rid="F0002">
       Figure 2
      </xref>
      ). In addition to potential lack of conservation between known and emerging HCoVs, targeting viral proteins can be problematic for drug discovery due to viral escape by mutation. Alternatively, antivirals that target conserved host factors utilized during the viral life cycle may also be potential pan-coronavirus antiviral therapeutics, but have the disadvantage of potential off-target effects.

         As an example of coronavirus virion (A) and genome (B) structure, a schematic of MERS-CoV (GenBank JX869059) is provided. Virions exist as enveloped viral particles, with the Spike (S), Membrane (M), and Envelope (E) proteins decorating the outside of the membrane. Coronaviruses in genogroup 2a have an additional structural protein hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which has been omitted from this discussion. Inside of the virion, the Nucleocapsid (N) protein encapsidates the viral genome. The viral genome is composed of + sense, single-stranded RNA. At the 5ʹ end of the genome, a single polyprotein open reading frame encodes the more highly conserved nonstructural proteins (ORF1a, ORF1b). At the 3ʹ end of the genome, the functionally conserved structural proteins that make up the virion are interspersed with virus-specific accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and ORF 8b). Accessory proteins are conserved between very closely related viruses like BatCoV-HKU4, BatCoV-HKU5, and MERS-CoV. There is no conservation of accessory proteins between known HCoVs.

       Targeting CoV nonstructural proteins
      </title>
      <p>
       Coronavirus nsps are highly conserved components of the coronavirus lifecycle that mediate viral replication including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like Protease (PLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The CoV RdRp replicates the viral RNA genome and generates viral RNA transcripts, essential functions that cannot be performed by cellular polymerases. Another essential element of the CoV lifecycle is proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins into functional nsps by two viral proteases, the 3CLpro and PLpro. In addition to polymerase and protease functions, other essential functions performed by the nsps of CoVs include immune antagonism, double membrane vesicle organization, scaffolding for replication complex formation, nucleic acid binding, helicase activity, and viral RNA proofreading which may be future targets of coronavirus specific antiviral drug discovery [

       Targeting CoV structural and accessory proteins
      </title>
      <p>
       Coronavirus structural proteins compose the virion, including the Spike (S) glycoprotein, Envelope (E) protein, Membrane (M) protein, and the Nucleopcapsid (N) protein (
       <xref rid="F0002">
        Figure 2
       </xref>
       ). These proteins also perform important functions in the viral life cycle: S is the main determinant of cell tropism, host range, and viral entry; E facilitates viral assembly and release, and has viroporin activity; M maintains the membrane structure of the virion; and N encapsidates the viral RNA genome. Although most of these functions are essential to viral infection, CoVs tolerated E deletion and remained replication competent, but viral fitness was impaired [
       <xref rid="CIT0110">
        110
       </xref>
       ]. Unfortunately, while structural protein functions are similar between CoVs, protein identity is less conserved than with nsps, making the development of pan-coronavirus therapeutics directly targeting structural proteins problematic. Genes encoding structural and accessory proteins are interspersed at the 3ʹ end of the coronavirus RNA genome (
       <xref rid="F0002">
        Figure 2
       </xref>
       ). Deletion of accessory protein genes using reverse genetics systems demonstrated that these proteins were not essential for viral replication, but impacted viral replication or viral fitness

        ]. As an example, antibodies generated against the S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV inhibited viral replication when administered 24 h prior to infection, as well as 24 h postinfection in a humanized DPP4 mouse model [
        <xref rid="CIT0078">
         78
        </xref>
        ]. In general, mAbs that were effective against CoV infection in animal models targeted the highly variable S glycoprotein, but these mAbs lack cross-protection against other related CoVs [
        <xref rid="CIT0114">
         114
        </xref>
        ]. Monoclonal antibodies developed against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or other emerging CoVs may require separate formulations for each virus due to differences in the targeted antigen. For example, mAbs targeted against S from 2003 SARS-CoV isolates failed to neutralize closely related BatCoV-SHC014 and only some mAbs neutralized BatCoV-WIV1 [
        <xref rid="CIT0015">

        ,
        <xref rid="CIT0016">
         16
        </xref>
        ]. In general, mAbs target specific epitopes, and viruses avoid neutralization by accruing mutations in the targeted epitope that allow viral escape from mAb therapy. Pre-clinical and clinical mAb formulations may include a cocktail of multiple mAbs that target different epitopes to ensure that viruses cannot escape neutralization. However, SARS-CoV S tolerated mutations in multiple epitopes allowing escape from neutralization from multiple mAbs, and the introduction of mAb escape mutations enhanced pathogenesis of the virus in some animal models [
        <xref rid="CIT0115">
         115
        </xref>
        ]. In sum, efficacious monoclonal antibody therapy against highly pathogenic coronaviruses may require several mAbs targeting conserved epitopes and rigorous testing is required to demonstrate that viral evasion of mAbs does not result in enhanced virulence.

        Coronavirus vaccines

       <p>
        Vaccines have long been considered the gold standard for infectious disease prevention and eradication targeted at human populations as well as conferring the benefits of long-lived immune protection for the individual. Zoonotic pathogens like coronaviruses emerge from animal reservoir species, thus vaccination strategies are unlikely to lead to eradication while the virus continues to circulate in reservoir hosts. One Health approaches to solving the problems of emerging infectious diseases consider the environment and animal health, as well as human health [
        <xref rid="CIT0116">
         116
        </xref>
        ]. For example, vaccination strategies targeting the camel intermediate host of MERS-CoV have been developed, which may work to repress viral replication in camels, preventing MERS-CoV transmission to humans [
        <xref rid="CIT0117">
         117
        </xref>
        ].
       </p>
       <p>
        In human infections of highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the most vulnerable populations are patients over the age of 65 and patients with comorbidities, and design of efficacious vaccines for patients in these groups is difficult. Vaccine formulations that have been developed against SARS-CoV not only fail to protect animal models of aged populations, but also result in immunopathology in younger populations, where SARS disease is enhanced in vaccinated groups that are subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [
        <xref rid="CIT0118">
         118

        ,
        <xref rid="CIT0119">
         119
        </xref>
        ]. In addition, vaccines generate memory immune responses to specific pathogens, and no vaccine formulations have been developed that are effective against multiple CoVs. Due to the diversity of BatCoVs, it seems unlikely that current therapeutic strategies targeting specific SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV antigens will be efficacious against future coronaviruses that emerge into the human population. Vaccines formulated against the SARS-CoV epidemic antigens do not offer effective protection against SARS-like BatCoVs that are currently circulating in bat populations [
        <xref rid="CIT0015">
         15
        </xref>

        Antiviral compounds that specifically target viral proteins may result in viral escape by mutation in the targeted viral proteins, as has been described with monoclonal antibodies and GS-5734 [

        ]. However, targeting conserved host mechanisms utilized by multiple coronavirus as an essential part of the viral life cycle is an approach to pan-coronavirus drug development where viral escape by mutation is less likely. Several groups have attempted to inhibit host proteases (including furin, cathepsins, and TMPRSS2) that process viral S glycoproteins at the cell surface during viral entry [

        ), combinations of protease inhibitors would be required for pan-coronavirus treatment regimens, particularly for emergent novel CoVs where host protease requirements have not been evaluated.

        Interferons (IFNs) are a class of immunomodulatory compounds produced by host cells in response to detection of pathogen-specific motifs, resulting in IFN secretion that affects not only the stimulated cell, but also neighboring cells.

Based on these potentially beneficial immunomodulatory properties in the context of infections, IFNs have been used for the treatment of emerging viral infections where no specific antiviral drugs yet exist, with the greatest benefits resulting from administration very early following infection. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Type I IFNs were effective at decreasing viral replication

Additional immunomodulatory compounds that regulate the expression of innate immune genes have been suggested as potential therapeutics for highly pathogenic coronaviruses; however, compounds that modulate the host response require significant testing in the most rigorous animal models before therapeutic applications could be pursued.

      Expert opinion

     <p>
      In response to outbreaks of previously unrecognized respiratory syndromes characterized by atypical pneumonia in 2003 and 2012, collaborative new research programs were quickly established that identified the etiologic agents involved as highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These coronaviruses may have the potential to cause devastating pandemics due to unique features in virus biology including rapid viral replication, broad host range, cross-species transmission, person-to-person transmission, and lack of herd immunity in human populations. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were contained by diligent enforcement of public health measures that limited viral spread to approximately 10,000 cases total for both SARS and MERS since 2003. However, the threat of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or an as-yet unknown BatCoV that causes severe disease in humans makes antiviral therapeutics that broadly target coronaviruses a highly desirable commodity to ensure global public health. The current challenge is to produce medical countermeasures that can protect vulnerable populations against known coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but that are also effective against novel highly pathogenic coronaviruses that may emerge from animal reservoir hosts.

      While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were rapidly identified following clinical reports of novel atypical pneumonia, progress in developing effective antivirals for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been impeded by several factors. A key finding from our review of the literature is that current animal models for highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adequate to support advanced development of antiviral therapeutics. MERS-CoV continues to circulate on the Arabian Peninsula, providing the opportunity to investigate some treatments of MERS in clinical trials. However, future emerging coronaviruses may require use of the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule for Investigational New Drugs (INDs). INDs must fulfill the Animal Efficacy Rule criteria of i) reasonable safety for initial use in humans, ii) pharmacological data that support reasonably well-understood mechanism of activity against the pathogen, and iii) efficacy in animal models with disease signs representative of clinical illness in humans (including one non-rodent model). While the vigorous pursuit of small animal models has been successful in generating rodent models that recapitulate severe SARS and MERS disease signs (including morbidity and mortality), progress in generating additional animal models has lagged, particularly in primate models of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. Past strategies for experimental treatment regimens primarily relied on combination therapies with approved drugs known to have acceptable safety profiles and broad-spectrum antiviral activity including IFNs, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. However, analyses of data returned from these treatments indicated that most regimens were not effective in treating SARS and MERS patients. With sufficient investment in the development of drug discovery pipeline model systems, pan-coronavirus targets based on supportive

         Currently, the state of pan-coronavirus drug discovery is not structured to provide adequate pre-clinical therapeutics to combat emerging CoV pathogens. A diverse array of coronaviruses is needed that includes epidemic isolates of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, zoonotic viruses isolated from intermediate reservoir hosts, pre-emergent CoVs from bats, and clinical isolates of mildly pathogenic HCoVs.

      systems of drug discovery is limited. Most of the emphasis of the discovery of coronavirus antivirals has been targeted toward the genus betacoronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, while therapeutics that target known coronavirus threats to public health are of paramount importance, it is critical to note that future outbreaks of emerging highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans could result from other coronavirus genera with unique tropism to different tissues, different clinical signs and symptoms, and altered transmission profiles that cannot be captured by limiting drug discovery studies to the very few viral strains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV currently available to researchers. Currently, Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources) is a source for a limited number of strains of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. Laboratory strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are available through the American Type Culture Collection, but strains of HCoV-HKU1 are not available through either resource. High throughput surrogate systems at biosafety level 2 are not well-developed and do not yet capture the phylogenetic diversity within the family
      <italic>
       Coronaviridae
      </italic>
      . Biosafety level 3 conditions are required for working with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or pre-emergent zoonotic strains due to the severe disease these viruses cause, which restricts the number of laboratories that can safely perform screening for pan-coronavirus therapeutics.
     </p>

      In the last 15 years, two outbreaks of previously unknown highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have demonstrated that CoVs will continue to spill over into human populations, likely facilitated by interaction between infected animals and humans. Reverse genetics approaches have generated pre-emergent BatCoVs from sequence, especially those related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These particularly novel avenues of research have identified that BatCoV strains with similar pathogenic profiles to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV continue to circulate within bat populations, indicating a continued vulnerability to highly pathogenic coronavirus emergence. While the next emerging coronavirus may be symptomatically or antigenically similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the possibility exists that novel highly pathogenic coronaviruses may be poised for spillover into human populations, with potentially disastrous consequences. Currently, public health measures have been adequate to stymie the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV primarily due to disease surveillance coupled with viruses with limited person-to-person transmission. However, biological factors that increase cross-species transmission or facilitate person-to-person spread may lead to future coronavirus strains not capable of being contained by timely quarantine of infected individuals. Any increase in highly pathogenic CoV virulence, pathogenesis, or transmission would likely require a targeted medical countermeasure. Without strategic research programs that fill the gaps identified in our literature review, medical countermeasures that target highly pathogenic coronaviruses cannot be brought to market, leaving global public health vulnerable to this emerging threat.

        SUMMARY
       </title>
       <p>
        The source of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was traced to wildlife market civets and ultimately to bats. Subsequent hunting for novel coronaviruses (CoVs) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 animal CoVs, including the prototype lineage C betacoronaviruses,
        <named-content content-type="genus-species">
         Tylonycteris
        </named-content>
        bat CoV HKU4 and
        <named-content content-type="genus-species">

        bat CoV HKU5; these are phylogenetically closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which has affected more than 1,000 patients with over 35% fatality since its emergence in 2012. All primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ failure. Antivirals with potent

        </italic>
        activities include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, interferons, mycophenolic acid, and lopinavir. They should be evaluated in suitable animal models before clinical trials. Developing an effective camel MERS-CoV vaccine and implementing appropriate infection control measures may control the continuing epidemic.

     The objective of the present study was to investigate circulating PDCoV strains in North Vietnam and to analyze their complete genome sequences. In October and December 2015, two cases of diarrhea were reported on pig farms located in Phu Xuyen-Ha Noi province and Thai-Thuy-Thai Binh province, both of which are located in northern Vietnam. The pig farm in Phu Xuyen-Ha Noi bred a farrow-to-finisher herd of 634 head. Clinical symptoms included vomiting and watery diarrhea, resulting in the death of some piglets less than 30 days old. Morbidity was 100% (80/80) for piglets, 93.8% (60/64) for weaning pigs, 72.3% (340/470) for growing pigs, and 65% (13/20) for gilts and sows. Mortality was 36.2% (29/80) for piglets and 13.3% (8/64) for weaning pigs; none of the growing pigs, gilts, or sows died. The pig farm in Thai-Thuy-Thai Binh province bred about 5,000 head, all aged from 2 to 6 months. Clinical symptoms were noted for about 14 days, and pigs of all ages were infected and had diarrhea. Morbidity was about 65% (3,250/5,000); however, the only clinical sign was diarrhea and no pigs died. Diarrheal fecal samples (n = 26) collected from the two pig farms were subjected to RT-PCR to test for the

Ten fecal samples from 21-day-old piglets at the farm in Phu Xuyen-Ha Noi were collected in October 2015, and all were positive for PDCoV; while none were positive for PEDV or TGEV. Sequence analysis of the PDCoV

     genes from the ten samples revealed 99.8–100% identity. Sixteen fecal samples (from pigs aged 2 to 5 months) were collected from Thai Thuy-Thai Binh in December 2015, and 14 were identified as PDCoV-positive by RT-PCR; while none were positive for PEDV or TGEV. The PDCoV
     <italic>
      N

     genes from these 14 samples were 99.7–100% identical at the nucleotide (nt) level. We sequenced the complete genome of one (HaNoi6) of the ten strains detected at Phu Xuyen-Ha Noi and one (Binh21) of the 14 strains detected at Thai-Thuy-Thai Binh and submitted them to GenBank under accession numbers KX834351–KX834352. The complete genome sequences were then aligned using the CLUSTALX alignment program [

     ). The complete genome of Binh 21 strain showed 98.4% identity at the nt level with the S5011 and TT_1115 stains from Thailand and the P1_16BTL_0115 strain from Laos (Table
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">

     ). The

     genes of the Binh21 and HaNoi6 strains were 99.8% identical at the nt level, but only 96.6–97.1% identical to strains from the USA, Korea, China, and Thailand. Interestingly, the S protein of Binh21 was 98.1–98.3% identical at the amino acid level to strains HKU15-44, Minnesota 159, and KNU14-04, but only 97.4% identical to strains from Thailand and Laos (Table
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">
      1
     </xref>
     ). However, phylogenetic analysis of the S gene/protein at the nucleotide and amino acid level revealed that Vietnam Binh21 and HaNoi6 strains were included in the same group with Thailand and Laos strains. The reason for this discrepancy between amino acid identity and phylogenetic tree analysis for the S gene is not clear, but it might be due to several unique sequences that determine each cluster on the phylogenetic tree. The amino acid sequences of the E and M proteins of HaNoi6 and Binh21 are 100% identical to those of the S5011, CH/S27, HKU15-44, Minnesota159, and KNU14-04 strains. The E and M proteins are transmembrane proteins associated with viral envelope formation and release [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">
      20
     </xref>
     ]. Compared with the HKU15-44 strain, the HaNoi6 and Binh21 strains lack a three nt (CTA) segment in the 5’ UTR (110–112 bp), six nt (TTTGAA) and nine nt (GCCGGTTGG) segments in ORF1a/1b (1,732–1,737 bp and 2,803–2,811 bp, respectively), and have a single nt (C) inserted in the 3’ UTR (25,042 bp). Also, compared with the S5011 strain, the HaNoi 6 and Binh21 strains have a single nt (A) inserted in the 5’ UTR (298 bp). After Clustal X multiple sequence alignment, three phylogenetic trees representing complete genome sequences as well as sequences of the S and M genes of 32 PDCoV strains from GenBank, including the two Vietnam PDCoV strains identified herein, were generated using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method, with the Tamura-Nei model and bootstrap analysis (n = 1000). This was performed using the MEGA 6.06 software with default parameters [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">
      16
     </xref>
     ]. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome, S gene, and M gene sequences showed that the two Vietnam PDCoV strains belong to the same lineage as three Thailand PDCoVs and one Laos PDCoV (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
      1
     </xref>
     A–C). Analysis of Thailand’s PDCoV strains suggested that they clustered as a novel lineage of PDCoV that was separate from the US-like and China-like lineage PDCoVs [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">
      8
     </xref>
     ]. The finding also suggested that the Thailand PDCoV isolates could have evolved from the same ancestor as other PDCoV strains but had differentiated at some point in the past [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">
      8
     </xref>
     ]. The origin and source of the PDCoVs introduced into North Vietnam is currently unknown, but phylogenetic analysis suggests that Hanoi6 and Binh21 are closely related to Thailand and Laos strains, a finding supported by the close geographic proximity of these regions. However, the ML tree revealed that the N genes of Hanoi6 and Binh21 belong to the same lineage as strains from the USA, Korea, China, and Hong Kong (Fig.
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
      1

     D). The N protein is involved in viral replication, function, and pathogenesis [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
      12

     ]. Therefore the two Vietnam PDCoV strains were analyzed using the recombination detection program (RDP). The recombination breakpoint was determined using the RDP method and confirmed statistically using the BootScan, MaxChi, and Chimaera applications (

     ). Recombination events are often reported in PEDV studies, and the majority are intra-recombinants of different lineages of the same type of enteric coronavirus [

     ]. A recent study of possible recombination events in PDCoV strains reported that the CHN-GD16-05 strain belonged to American and Korean lineages, while the CHN-GD16-03 strain was similar to a Thailand strain, but only in terms of the

     ]. The HaNoi6 strain, belonging to the same lineage as Thailand PDCoV strains, has a mortality rate in piglets and weaning pigs of 36.2% and 13.3%, respectively. HaNoi6 was also observed in gilts and sows, indicating that the pathogenicity of PDCoV is not confined to piglets.

     In conclusion, genetic analyses, based on complete genome sequences, demonstrated that HaNoi6 and Binh21 strains from North Vietnam are similar to PDCoV strains from Thailand and Laos. Like Thailand’s PDCoV strains, the HaNoi6 strain is highly virulent and pathogenic to piglets. Recombination events in the two Vietnamese PDCoV strains were identified in the
     <italic>
      N
     </italic>
     gene region. The genetic lineages of PDCoV strains from different countries appears to differ, suggesting that they may recombine and evolve continuously to generate diverse genotypes.

        Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003. Isolation is the separation of ill persons from non-infected persons. Quarantine is movement restriction, often with fever surveillance, of contacts when it is not evident whether they have been infected but are not yet symptomatic or have not been infected. Community containment includes measures that range from increasing social distancing to community-wide quarantine. Whether these measures will be sufficient to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions.

     The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 quickly spread within Hubei province and has now reached all provinces in China and was exported to &gt;20 countries by 30 January 2020. 2019-nCoV is thought to be primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and generation time as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

     SARS was frightening at the time, maybe even more frightening compared to 2019-nCoV (now renamed COVID-19) given its much more frequent progression to severe disease and death. But the world was able to completely interrupt human-to-human transmission, halt the epidemic and SARS-CoV is now eradicated. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, this remarkable achievement was only possible because of rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are yet again faced with a situation of an outbreak with a closely related virus for which we currently have no specific therapeutics or vaccines. Again, we need to rely on classical public health measures to curb the epidemic of this respiratory disease. The primary goal of such public health measures is to prevent person-to-person spread of disease by separating people to interrupt transmission. The tools we have at hand are isolation and quarantine, social distancing and community containment. All these tools are currently being employed at an unprecedented massive scale in China. Here we define these tools, explain how they are being used to control the novel coronavirus, and elaborate on the benefits and challenges.
    </p>

     ‘Isolation’ is the separation of ill persons with contagious diseases from non-infected persons to protect non-infected persons, and usually occurs in hospital settings. An isolation room could also be equipped with negative pressure to reduce transmission via aerosols, but for large droplets like for SARS CoV, control was achieved without negative pressure rooms. Isolation of patients is particularly effective in interrupting transmission if early detection is possible before overt viral shedding. Given that influenza patients can already transmit before clinical symptoms set it, isolation is often too late to be sufficiently effective to halt transmission and control an influenza pandemic. However, for SARS CoV the incubation time is longer than for influenza (about 5 versus 2 days),
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">
      <sup>
       3
      </sup>
     </xref>
     and viral shedding was highest once the patient is truly sick. A longer incubation time allows for more time to identify cases and put them into isolation. The incubation time of the 2019-nCoV also has a median of 5 days,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">
      <sup>
       4
      </sup>
     </xref>
     however, at this stage, it remains unknown when viral shedding and transmissibility peaks and how frequently pre-symptomatic cases result in secondary cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘Quarantine’ is one of the oldest and most effective tools of controlling communicable disease outbreaks. This public health practice was used widely in fourteenth century Italy, when ships arriving at the Venice port from plague-infected ports had to anchor and wait for 40 days (in Italian: quaranta for 40) before disembarking their surviving passengers.
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">
      <sup>
       5
      </sup>
     </xref>
     Forty days provided ample time for the incubation time to be completed so that yet asymptomatic cases became symptomatic and could therefore be identified. Quarantine was implemented successfully as an effective measure during the SARS epidemic in 2003.
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">
      <sup>
       6
      </sup>
     </xref>
     It is also an important component of pandemic influenza plans. Quarantine means the movement restriction of persons who are presumed to have been exposed to a contagious disease but are not ill, either because they did not become infected or because they are still in the incubation period.
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">
      <sup>

      </sup>
     </xref>
     Quarantine may be applied at the individual or group level and usually involves restriction to the home or a designated facility. Quarantine may be voluntary or mandatory. During quarantine, all individuals should be monitored for the occurrence of any symptoms. If such symptoms occur, they must be immediately isolated in a designated centre familiar with treating severe respiratory illness. Quarantining is most successful in settings where detection of cases is prompt, contacts can be listed and traced within a short time frame with prompt issuance of quarantine with voluntary compliance to this issuance.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘Social distancing’ is designed to reduce interactions between people in a broader community, in which individuals may be infectious but have not yet been identified hence not yet isolated. As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing of persons will reduce transmission. Social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission.
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">
      <sup>
       8
      </sup>
     </xref>
     Examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets, and cancellation of gatherings.
    </p>
    <p>
     If these measures are deemed to be insufficient, ‘community-wide containment’ may need to be implemented. Community-wide containment is an intervention applied to an entire community, city or region, designed to reduce personal interactions, except for minimal interaction to ensure vital supplies. It is a continuum to expand from social distancing to community-wide quarantine with major movement restrictions of everyone. Enforcement of community-wide containment measures is far more complex given the larger number of persons involved. Such measures are also ethically more challenging with individual human rights weighing against the public health imperative. The advent of social media is an additional challenge to ensure compliance. During such community-wide quarantine, it is particularly important to wisely use social media as social media provides an opportunity for communicating the reasons for quarantine, reassurance and practical advice and to pre-empt false rumours and panic. Implementation requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement at the local and state level, and often involves checkpoints, and may need legal penalties if quarantine violations occur. A community-wide quarantine is currently happening in China on an order of magnitude that mankind has never witnessed before.

     China has been preparing to contain future pandemics by applying lessons learnt from SARS ever since 2003.

     We have to commend China for their swift and decisive response. Within a matter of weeks, China implemented all the tools ranging from case detection with immediate isolation, and contact tracing with quarantining and medical observation of all contacts. By 2 February 2020, 14 600 cases had been confirmed, and &gt;20 000 cases were classified as suspect cases waiting for laboratory results, 113 579 close contacts were been tracked and 4201 people were released from medical observation. A total of 102 427 people were receiving medical observation. This is an unprecedented gigantic effort that surpasses all quarantine measures during SARS. However, the sheer magnitude of the new cases means that not all contacts can possibly be ascertained or monitored adequately. It means that many unidentified contacts are in the community. While SARS was mainly an outbreak that propagated itself within hospitals and confined communities (Hotel Metropole, Amoy Gardens etc), widespread community transmission is already evident for 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province and beyond. Hence, the most drastic of all classical public health measures was the only logical next step: community containment with social distancing, community-use of facemasks at all times and the city of Wuhan with 11 million residents was locked-in with the shutdown of the city’s public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries and the airport. Prior to the lock-down in Wuhan, about 5 million (many of whom were already infected) left Wuhan thus contributing to further spread. As the community-based outbreak spread, lock-down was extended to &gt;60 million residents in &gt;20 cities by 30 January 2020. China has issued the largest quarantine in history.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are multiple implications for travellers: national borders may be closed or they may be barred from entry into cities or provinces where community containment is being implemented. International travellers already locked into such areas will not be able to leave unless their governments charter airplanes to fly them out, and even then it may be difficult to reach the airport due to blocked roads. Indeed, most governments are now in the process of evacuating their citizens, and such passengers will be subject to 14 days quarantine upon arrival in their home country. Quarantining of those returning travellers or expats will occur at designated facilities (including islands for some countries) with medical observation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Public health measures were successful for SARS because the vast majority of SARS patients were symptomatic, and were thus identifiable and could be isolated. Viral loads peaked at 6–11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, and overall, peak viral loads were reached at 12–14 days of illness when patients were usually already in hospital care.
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">
      <sup>
       10
      </sup>
     </xref>
     Low or absence of viral shedding in the first few days of illness meant that early isolation measures could be effective. The incubation time allowed for timely isolation, and also for contacts to be traced and quarantined in time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The victory of old-type public health tools over SARS provides impetus to continue such stringent measures for the novel coronavirus. Given the trajectory of this outbreak, it is now a matter of whether we are able to scale up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase of cases and geographical spread.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether these rigorous measures will result in the same victory as for SARS depends on the following questions that currently remain unanswered: (i) what is the proportion of subclinical disease (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) that would be missed by the case definition, hence not be identified and immediately isolated, and therefore contribute to community transmission? (ii) On what day of illness is peak viral shedding, and how much viral shedding occurs before onset of symptoms? (iii) Does viral shedding occur also beyond respiratory droplets, e.g. via fomites? (iv) What is the true case fatality rate if the denominator also takes milder cases into account?
    </p>
    <p>
     The answers to these questions will drive the response. Preliminary insights from clusters in Vietnam and Germany unveil that even mildly symptomatic persons may contribute to transmission.

      </sup>
     </xref>
     If this is indeed more frequent, then old-style public health measures will not be sufficient and we need to await vaccines to halt the epidemic.
    </p>
    <p>
     The initial case fatality rate was reported to be 15%, but the initial cases were biased towards the severe end of the disease, with rapidly rising cases, it is now thought to be around 2–3%. Until we understand the full clinical spectrum of the disease, we will not know the case fatality rate. What we do know is that disease severity does not drive transmissibility. Although the case fatality rate may be far lower than that of SARS-CoV, the greatest concern could be that this novel virus behaves epidemiologically like influenza viruses, will defy all old-style public health measures, and turn into a pandemic with many more deaths than SARS.

        Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats. This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of

         Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8
        </italic>
        (previously reported in

        <italic>
         Miniopterus

        <italic>
         Pteropus alecto
        </italic>
        which is most closely related to
        <italic>
         Bat coronavirus HKU9
        </italic>
        identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.

      Novel coronaviruses were responsible for the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003–2004, and for the ongoing sporadic outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first described in 2012 (Drosten et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">

      ; Zaki et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">

      ). Bats have been identified as the natural hosts of the progenitor viruses of both SARS and MERS coronaviruses (Lau et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">

      ). Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats, given their evident potential to host novel zoonotic coronaviruses (Woo et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">
       2006
      </xref>
      ). The majority of these studies were based on reverse-transcriptase PCR detection of coronavirus RNA in bat faeces and tissues, or serological detection of coronavirus antibodies in blood samples. Coronaviruses have been detected in 11 of the 18 extant families of bats in more than 25 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas (Drexler et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">

      ).

      Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses. Their taxonomy has undergone major revision over the past decade, primarily because of the identification of a suite of novel coronaviruses in bats. The family

      is now divided into the two subfamilies of

      The diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region has not yet been reported. Given the zoonotic potential of bat coronaviruses, a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of these viruses is essential to identify any potential threat to human health and to inform biosecurity preparedness. With this aim, we undertook a virological and serological survey of various bat populations in Australia and neighbouring countries for evidence of coronavirus infection. We focused primarily on insectivorous bats, which reportedly host the largest diversity of bat coronaviruses, and particularly targeted bats of the genus
      <italic>
       Rhinolophus
      </italic>
      , recognised as hosting SARS-like coronaviruses. We also compared relative detection frequency in various potential routes of excretion.

        Fieldwork: Bat Capture and Sample Collection

        Fieldwork was undertaken at multiple locations in Australia and Taiwan between 2006 and 2009, using harp traps to capture insectivorous bats. Particular effort was made to capture bats at locations where rhinolophid bats were previously known to be present. Captured bats were individually housed in clean cloth bags and a polystyrene cooler prior to sample collection. Bat identification was based on morphological characteristics (Churchill
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
         2008
        </xref>
        ) and was undertaken by experienced biologists. Occasionally, bats were only identified to genus level. All bats were released at their point of capture within 6 h. A single faecal pellet (collected directly from a defecating bat or from its clean cloth bag) was placed into 1 ml of sucrose potassium glutamate albumin (SPGA) with added penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone. When no faecal pellet was obtained, the anus was swabbed and the swab placed in 1 ml SPGA, and stored at 4°C prior to RNA extraction. Faecal samples collected from bats in Taiwan were placed into 1 ml of AVL buffer from the QIAamp

        Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and stored at room temperature for 1 week prior to extraction. Faecal swabs from 33

       Phylogenetic analysis of a 440 bp sequence from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from representative sequences from this study, and from 33 other sequences including the ICTV reference coronaviruses, was conducted using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model (Nei and Kumar

Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained by applying the Neighbour-Joining method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach.

After washing with PBST buffer, the plate was incubated for 30 min with blocking buffer (2% skimmed milk in PBST). Testing sera were diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min, followed by washing with PBST. HRP-conjugated Protein-A/G (1:1 mix, ZYMED Laboratories) was used to detect the bound bat antibodies by incubation for 30 min with a 1:2000 diluted solution. After washing, TMB substrate was added for colour development and the reading was taken after 10 min at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Multiskan Ascent, Thermo Labsystems).

      Discussion
     </title>
     <p id="Par23">
      This is the first report of detection of coronavirus RNA and anti-coronavirus antibodies in bats in the Australasian region, and illustrates that bats in the region are host to a range of coronaviruses. The prevalence of each varied across species and location, with the prevalence of either viral RNA or antibodies being relatively high in some populations. This variability highlights the complexity of exposure, infection and immune dynamics over space and time. In two species with relatively large sample sizes (
      <italic>
       Miniopterus australis
      </italic>
      and
      <italic>
       M. schreibersii
      </italic>
      in south-east Queensland), 25% of 154 individuals and 27% of 238 individuals, respectively, were positive for coronavirus RNA. Studies elsewhere have shown similar prevalence rates (Tsuda et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">
       2012
      </xref>
      ; Suzuki et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">
       2014
      </xref>
      ); others have reported much lower prevalence (Anthony et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">
       2013
      </xref>
      ). Seroprevalence in our study was also high in some populations, including those that were negative for viral RNA. This antibody-positive, viral RNA-negative finding most plausibly reflects previous infection. Alternatively, virus excretion associated with current infection may have been occurring at a concentration below the detection level of the RT-PCR assay. In some cases, the limited sample size may have constrained detection of viral RNA in the sampled population. Although there have been fewer serological studies than molecular studies in bats, others have also found high coronavirus antibody prevalence in some bat species, albeit using a different serological assay (Tsuda et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">
       2012
      </xref>
      ). Indeed, given that our ELISA was based on SARS-CoV antigens, it may be that broader coronavirus seroprevalence is underestimated.
     </p>
     <p id="Par24">
      Our molecular analysis was based on highly conserved 440-bp sequence of the coronavirus RdRp gene, a common length and site for sequence data analyses conducted in many other bat coronavirus studies. Although constrained by the short length of sequence, we were able to identify four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. To obtain a surrogate estimation of taxonomy, Drexler et al. (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">
       2010
      </xref>
      ) proposed a scheme based on 816-bp sequence of the RdRp gene to form RdRp grouping units (RGU), defining species separation in mammalian coronaviruses, with &gt;4.8% amino acid sequence distance for alphacoronaviruses and &gt;6.3% amino acid sequence distance for betacoronaviruses. While our field and laboratory work predated this publication and thus precluded use of the approach, based on nucleotide sequence identity, the three novel coronavirus genotypes identified in our study may represent new species. Regardless, our findings support the hypothesis of Woo et al. (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">
       2006
      </xref>
      ) that bats host a large diversity of novel coronaviruses.
     </p>
     <p id="Par25">
      Despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa of SARS coronaviruses (Lau et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">
       2005a
      </xref>
      ; Li et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">
       2005
      </xref>
      ), and testing faecal samples from more than 500 individuals from multiple locations and detecting alphacoronavirus RNA, we did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses. We did detect anti-coronavirus antibodies in a small percentage of
      <italic>
       R. megaphyllus

      <italic>
       Rhinonicteris aurantia
      </italic>
      is most closely related to betacoronavirus sequence identified in Ghana from bats of the same family Hipposideridae (Pfefferle et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">

      ), although the lower sequence identity should be noted. Finally, our betacoronavirus genotype from
      <italic>
       P. alecto
      </italic>
      is most closely related to
      <italic>
       Bat coronavirus HKU9

      , identified in
      <italic>

      from the Philippines, all of which belong to the family
      <italic>
       Pteropodidae
      </italic>
      . Notwithstanding the limited number of sequences and modest size of the amplicon evaluated, our findings support the contention that, regardless of location, bats belonging to the same species, genus or family are likely to host closely related coronaviruses. With the recent revision of the taxonomy of bats using comparative-method and molecular studies (Hutcheon and Kirsch
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">
       2006
      </xref>
      ), the suborder
      <italic>
       Pteropodiformes
      </italic>
      now comprises, amongst others, bats from the families
      <italic>
       Hipposideridae
      </italic>
      ,
      <italic>
       Rhinolophidae

      and
      <italic>
       Pteropodidae
      </italic>
      . To date, betacoronaviruses have been identified predominantly from bats of these families, so it appears that the host-virus association of bat coronaviruses may extend to bats of the same suborder. Thus, as yet unidentified betacoronaviruses may still be found in other species in other families (

      bats at the same roost site (Table
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">

      <italic>

      </italic>
      is not (yet) occurring. The genus
      <italic>
       Rhinolophus
      </italic>
      is hypothesised to be more likely to foster host shifts and foster the emergence of coronaviruses than other genera (Cui et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       2007
      </xref>
      ), and our observation is consistent with this. Similarly, our detection of coronavirus RNA in one of the 126
      <italic>
       R. aurantia

      in the absence of any seropositivity in the population may also suggest transmission from another bat species. The sampled
      <italic>
       R. aurantia

      population was co-roosting with populations of
      <italic>

      and
      <italic>
       Macroderma gigas
      </italic>
      bats (Fig. 3), both of which were positive for anti-coronavirus antibodies, and although negative for coronavirus RNA at the time of sampling, constitute a plausible source of infection. Further investigation of these two species, beyond the scope of this study, is necessary to test this hypothesis. The alternative interpretation of the single RNA detection in both

      and
      <italic>
       R. aurantia

      is that the PCR results are spurious. However, we believe that the rigour of our field and laboratory techniques make cross-contamination of samples highly unlikely.

      Two methods of evolution have been proposed to explain the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses and their host specificity (Cui et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       2007
      </xref>
      ; Vijaykrishna et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">
       2007
      </xref>
      ). Divergent evolution requires the cross-species transmission of a common ancestor virus and subsequent adaption and establishment in the new host. To account for the identification of related coronaviruses in related species of bats in different locations throughout the world, divergent evolution requires the global distribution of each newly diverged coronavirus. This process is theoretically possible for those bat species that exhibit long-range nomadic movement (Breed et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">
       2010
      </xref>
      ). The second evolutionary method is the co-evolution of bat species and their coronaviruses (Cui et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       2007
      </xref>
      ), whereby the divergence of each bat species is mirrored by the divergence of the coronavirus it hosts. This method accounts for the diversity, relatedness and global distribution of bat coronaviruses, but would require the age of bat coronaviruses to parallel that of the most common bat ancestor, i.e. 65 million years (Churchill
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">
       2008
      </xref>
      ). In addition, co-evolution alone does not explain the presence of different coronavirus genera in the same species or genus; for example, hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats hosting both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (Woo et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">
       2006
      </xref>
      ; Pfefferle et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
       2009
      </xref>
      ), which intuitively appear to require episodes of host-shifting. Our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity of coronaviruses and host specificity in Australasian bats reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift, most plausibly by hipposiderid and/or rhinolophid bats (Cui et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       2007
      </xref>
      ). The significance of host geography and host ecology on virus evolution and host-virus interactions has recently been canvassed for bat rabies virus (Streicker et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">
       2010
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">
       2012
      </xref>
      ). The concepts may be equally relevant for coronaviruses across the geographic and taxonomic spectrum, and warrant future investigation beyond the scope of this regional study.

     <p id="Par29">
      The majority of coronaviruses previously reported in bats were detected in faecal samples or rectal swabs indicating a predominantly enteric tropism (Lau et al.

      ; Lau et al.
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">

      ). From the (albeit limited) number of bats from which additional sample types were tested in this study (
      <italic>
       n
      </italic>
      = 30), coronavirus RNA was detected in oropharyngeal swabs (

      = 2) only from animals that were RNA-positive in faecal samples (
      <italic>
       n
      </italic>
      = 11), supporting a predominantly enteric tropism of bat coronaviruses. Corroborative studies are needed given our limited sample size. Lack of viral RNA detection in blood samples indicates that blood is not useful for the detection of bat coronaviruses.

      Conclusion
     </title>
     <p id="Par30">
      This study identified coronavirus RNA and antibodies in a range of bat taxa in Australia and the neighbouring countries of East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. Four different coronavirus genotypes were identified, including one alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses that are evidently novel. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and provide further support for the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. The findings advance our knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses in bats. This diversity, the global distribution of bats, and the propensity of coronaviruses to successfully cross species barriers, suggests MERS and SARS-like coronaviruses may not be the only bat coronaviruses that can cause disease outbreaks in humans, and further highlights the need for ongoing investigation of bats and their coronaviruses.

        In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article. In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.

      Introduction

     <p id="para0006">
      There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated from Wuhan, China and has now spread to 140 other countries, including Japan, Korea and Italy. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 has become a global health concern, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family but is distinct from SARS-CoV (identity of approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (identity of approximately 50%)

      . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares a high level of genetic similarity (96.3%) with the bat coronavirus RaTG13, which was obtained from bats in Yunnan in 2013; however, bats are not the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2

      The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough or dyspnea coupled with recent exposure. As of March 16, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 generated 168 826 confirmed cases, including 6503 deaths worldwide. In China during the outbreak of the pandemic, 42 000 doctors and nurses from all over the country supported Wuhan. Moreover, the government shared the updated genome sequence of COVID-19 to the public, and scientists from China and overseas are working closely and efficiently on this public health emergency

      . Due to interventions and control measures from the government (shutting down public transportation and implementing a treatment strategy) and the change in personal behaviors (wearing masks and reducing contact with others), the number of confirmed and suspected cases in China has started to decrease.

      However, the transmission of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been eliminated. The COVID-19 outbreak is still a major challenge for clinicians. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19.

       A study of early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 revealed that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days

       Basic reproduction number

      <p id="para0010">
       The basic reproduction number is model-based, largely depends on the epidemiological setting, and is the most important parameter to determine intrinsic transmissibility. The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0007">
        [7]

       . Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58

        [12]

      . According to current diagnostic criteria founded by the China National Health Commission, laboratory examinations, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests, have become a standard assessment for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. To identify patients earlier, two one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were developed to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0019">

      . Three novel RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro; highly sensitive and specific assays may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19

      . Chest CT scans can be used to assess the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 also manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia

      . In the COVID-19 pandemic, China issued the largest quarantine in history. All the residents living in mainland China were locked-in, and city public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and airports, were shutdown. Given the trajectory of this outbreak, the Chinese government scaled up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase in cases and geographical spread. The Wuhan government made full use of the gym and two convention centers and transformed them into makeshift hospitals with 3400 beds in only one night to isolate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls. More makeshift hospitals are under construction. Isolation beds were quickly expanded from only 137 at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 to 56 000 to separate infected patients from non-infected individuals. The swift and decisive response of China contributed to reducing the control reproduction number and transmission risk. Due to the powerful and effective isolation measures taken by the Chinese government, the increase in COVID-19 began to slow down on February 14, 2020, according to the data released by the China National Health Commission.

       There is no current evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to recommend any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment for patients with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Lopinavir (LPV) inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus in vitro and in animal studies. A retrospective, matched-cohort study including 1052 SARS patients showed that LPV/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate (2.3% vs. 11.0%)

The results of these clinical trials will be revealed in April 2020. Remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb only slightly reduced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improved pulmonary function, but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology [49].

Current interim guidance from the WHO on the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected (released January 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. The clinical outcomes of coronavirus and similar outbreaks do not support the use of corticosteroids.

      <p id="para0018">
       The development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 has important implications. Considering the relatively high identity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with the COVID-19 spike protein was assessed. The spike protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Fortunately, the SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds potently with the COVID-19 RBD
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0076">
        [76]
       </xref>
       . However, other SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies 230, m396 and 80R cannot bind to the COVID-19 RBD
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0077">
        [77]
       </xref>
       . CR3022 may be a potential therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. Antibodies MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were designed for treatment of Ebola virus infection and significantly reduce mortality from Ebola virus disease
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0047">
        [47]
       </xref>
       . Monoclonal antibodies can only recognize a single antigen epitope, which limits the use of MAb114 and REGN-EB3 in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the development of COVID-19-specific antibodies requires a long time. It is not easy to apply monoclonal antibodies for new pathogens to clinical practice in a short time.

       . The National Health Commission of China appealed to convalescent patients to donate blood for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Convalescent plasma should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer. The difficulty in obtaining plasma during convalescence limits its clinical application. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.

       . In November 2019, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V. in Europe for their Ebola vaccine, Ervebo. Fortunately, Moderna company announced on February 24, 2020 that the company's experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, is ready for human testing. It is a remarkably fast development cycle to develop an initial vaccine just weeks after identifying the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. The clinical trial of safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in the treatment of COVID-19 is under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04283461). Moreover, a new oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been successfully developed at Tianjin University, which uses food-grade safe

       as a carrier and targets the S protein. There are 18 biotechnology companies and universities in China working on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed much faster than those for Ebola because of the collaborative efforts of scientists around the world and the fast-track approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts by the Chinese health organizations.

      . While the origin of COVID-19 is still being investigated, COVID-19 has features typical of the Coronaviridae family and was classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. COVID-19 can be transmitted between humans. Interventions, including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, with the effect of travel restrictions. Wearing masks, washing hands and disinfecting surfaces contribute to reducing the risk of infection. Human coronaviruses can be efficiently inactivated within 1 min using surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite

      Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, control the pandemic, and reduce the economic impact of COVID-19 on China and the world. In acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions. The positive rate of PCR from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high. In this situation, more swab testing is needed to clarify diagnosis. Typical CT findings can help early screening of suspected cases and diagnosis of COVID-19.

      The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, and all countries need a coordinated international effort to fight COVID-19. The transmission of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been eliminated. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, isolation and quarantine are achieving remarkable results. It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of COVID-19 and to develop drugs and vaccines against the COVID-19 infection as soon as possible.

        Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface, an unusually large RNA genome, and a unique replication strategy. Coronaviruses cause a variety of diseases in mammals and birds ranging from enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease in chickens to potentially lethal human respiratory infections. Here we provide a brief introduction to coronaviruses discussing their replication and pathogenicity, and current prevention and treatment strategies. We also discuss the outbreaks of the highly pathogenic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identified Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

      All viruses in the

      order are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses. They all contain very large genomes for RNA viruses, with some viruses having the largest identified RNA genomes, containing up to 33.5 kilobase (kb) genomes. Other common features within the
      <italic>
       Nidovirales
      </italic>
      order include: (1) a highly conserved genomic organization, with a large replicase gene preceding structural and accessory genes; (2) expression of many non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting; (3) several unique or unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the large replicase–transcriptase polyprotein; and (4) expression of downstream genes by synthesis of 3′ nested sub-genomic mRNAs. In fact, the

      order name is derived from these nested 3′ mRNAs as

      is Latin for “nest.” The major differences within the Nidovirus families are in the number, type, and sizes of the structural proteins. These differences cause significant alterations in the structure and morphology of the nucleocapsids and virions.

      Genomic Organization

     <p id="Par4">
      Coronaviruses contain a non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome of ~30 kb. The genome contains a 5′ cap structure along with a 3′ poly (A) tail, allowing it to act as an mRNA for translation of the replicase polyproteins. The replicase gene encoding the non-structural proteins (nsps) occupies two-thirds of the genome, about 20 kb, as opposed to the structural and accessory proteins, which make up only about 10 kb of the viral genome. The 5′ end of the genome contains a leader sequence and untranslated region (UTR) that contains multiple stem loop structures required for RNA replication and transcription. Additionally, at the beginning of each structural or accessory gene are transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) that are required for expression of each of these genes (

      on RNA replication). The 3′ UTR also contains RNA structures required for replication and synthesis of viral RNA. The organization of the coronavirus genome is 5′-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3′ UTR-poly (A) tail with accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3′ end of the genome (Fig.

      ). The accessory proteins are almost exclusively nonessential for replication in tissue culture; however, some have been shown to have important roles in viral pathogenesis [

      Virion Structure
     </title>
     <p id="Par5">
      Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm as depicted in recent studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">

      ]. The most prominent feature of coronaviruses is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion. These spikes are a defining feature of the virion and give them the appearance of a solar corona, prompting the name, coronaviruses. Within the envelope of the virion is the nucleocapsid. Coronaviruses have helically symmetrical nucleocapsids, which is uncommon among positive-sense RNA viruses, but far more common for negative-sense RNA viruses.

     <p id="Par6">
      Coronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins. These are the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, all of which are encoded within the 3′ end of the viral genome. The S protein (~150 kDa), utilizes an N-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the ER, and is heavily N-linked glycosylated. Homotrimers of the virus encoded S protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">

      </xref>
      ] and mediates attachment to the host receptor [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">
       7
      </xref>
      ]. In most, coronaviruses, S is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides noted S1 and S2 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">
       8

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">
       9
      </xref>
      ]. S1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule [

      ].

      The M protein is the most abundant structural protein in the virion. It is a small (~25–30 kDa) protein with three transmembrane domains [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">
       11
      </xref>
      ] and is thought to give the virion its shape. It has a small N-terminal glycosylated ectodomain and a much larger C-terminal endodomain that extends 6–8 nm into the viral particle [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
       12
      </xref>

Recent studies suggest the M protein exists as a dimer in the virion, and may adopt two different conformations, allowing it to promote membrane curvature as well as to bind to the nucleocapsid [

       The initial attachment of the virion to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its receptor. The sites of receptor binding domains (RBD) within the S1 region of a coronavirus S protein vary depending on the virus, with some having the RBD at the N-terminus of S1 (MHV), while others (SARS-CoV) have the RBD at the C-terminus of S1 [

Many coronaviruses utilize peptidases as their cellular receptor. It is unclear why peptidases are used, as entry occurs even in the absence of the enzymatic domain of these proteins. Many α-coronaviruses utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) as their receptor, SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, MHV enters through CEACAM1, and the recently identified MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) to gain entry into human cells (

       Following receptor binding, the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol. This is generally accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein by a cathepsin, TMPRRS2 or another protease, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. S protein cleavage occurs at two sites within the S2 portion of the protein, with the first cleavage important for separating the RBD and fusion domains of the S protein [

       ] and the second for exposing the fusion peptide (cleavage at S2′). Fusion generally occurs within acidified endosomes, but some coronaviruses, such as MHV, can fuse at the plasma membrane. Cleavage at S2′ exposes a fusion peptide that inserts into the membrane, which is followed by joining of two heptad repeats in S2 forming an antiparallel six-helix bundle [

       The next step in the coronavirus lifecycle is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA. The replicase gene encodes two large ORFs, rep1a and rep1b, which express two co-terminal polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
        1
       </xref>
       ). In order to express both polyproteins, the virus utilizes a slippery sequence (5′-UUUAAAC-3′) and an RNA pseudoknot that cause ribosomal frameshifting from the rep1a reading frame into the rep1b ORF. In most cases, the ribosome unwinds the pseudoknot structure, and continues translation until it encounters the rep1a stop codon. Occasionally the pseudoknot blocks the ribosome from continuing elongation, causing it to pause on the slippery sequence, changing the reading frame by moving back one nucleotide, a -1 frameshift, before the ribosome is able to melt the pseudoknot structure and extend translation into rep1b, resulting in the translation of pp1ab [

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">

       ]. In vitro studies predict the incidence of ribosomal frameshifting to be as high as 25 %, but this has not been determined in the context of virus infection. It is unknown exactly why these viruses utilize frameshifting to control protein expression, but it is hypothesized to either control the precise ratio of rep1b and rep1a proteins or delay the production of rep1b products until the products of rep1a have created a suitable environment for RNA replication [

       Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab contain the nsps 1–11 and 1–16, respectively. In pp1ab, nsp11 from pp1a becomes nsp12 following extension of pp1a into pp1b. However, γ-coronaviruses do not contain a comparable nsp1. These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into the individual nsps [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">
        35
       </xref>
       ]. Coronaviruses encode either two or three proteases that cleave the replicase polyproteins. They are the papain-like proteases (PLpro), encoded within nsp3, and a serine type protease, the main protease, or Mpro, encoded by nsp5. Most coronaviruses encode two PLpros within nsp3, except the γ-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which only express one PLpro [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">
        36

       Next, many of the nsps assemble into the replicase–transcriptase complex (RTC) to create an environment suitable for RNA synthesis, and ultimately are responsible for RNA replication and transcription of the sub-genomic RNAs. The nsps also contain other enzyme domains and functions, including those important for RNA replication, for example nsp12 encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain; nsp13 encodes the RNA helicase domain and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity; nsp14 encodes the exoribonuclease (ExoN) involved in replication fidelity and N7-methyltransferase activity; and nsp16 encodes 2′-O-methyltransferase activity. In addition to the replication functions other activities, such as blocking innate immune responses (nsp1; nsp16-2′-O-methyl transferase; nsp3-deubiquitinase) have been identified for some of the nsps, while others have largely unknown functions (nsp3-ADP-ribose-1″-phosphatase; nsp15-endoribo-nuclease (NendoU)).

       Viral RNA synthesis follows the translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Viral RNA synthesis produces both genomic and sub-genomic RNAs. Sub-genomic RNAs serve as mRNAs for the structural and accessory genes which reside downstream of the replicase polyproteins. All positive-sense sub-genomic RNAs are 3′ co-terminal with the full-length viral genome and thus form a set of nested RNAs, a distinctive property of the order
       <italic>
        Nidovirales
       </italic>
       . Both genomic and sub-genomic RNAs are produced through negative-strand intermediates. These negative-strand intermediates are only about 1 % as abundant as their positive-sense counterparts and contain both poly-uridylate and anti-leader sequences [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">
        38
       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p id="Par17">
       Many cis-acting sequences are important for the replication of viral RNAs. Within the 5′ UTR of the genome are seven stem-loop structures that may extend into the replicase 1a gene [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">
        39

       –
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">
        42
       </xref>
       ]. The 3′ UTR contains a bulged stem-loop, a pseudoknot, and a hypervariable region [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">
        43
       </xref>
       –
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">
        46
       </xref>
       ]. Interestingly, the stem-loop and the pseudoknot at the 3′ end overlap, and thus cannot form simultaneously [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">
        44
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">
        47
       </xref>
       ]. Therefore, these different structures are proposed to regulate alternate stages of RNA synthesis, although exactly which stages are regulated and their precise mechanism of action are still unknown.
      </p>
      <p id="Par18">
       Perhaps the most novel aspect of coronavirus replication is how the leader and body TRS segments fuse during production of sub-genomic RNAs. This was originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis, but now it is largely believed to occur during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand RNA [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">
        48
       </xref>
       ]. The current model proposes that the RdRp pauses at any one of the body TRS sequences (TRS-B); following this pause the RdRp either continues elongation to the next TRS or it switches to amplifying the leader sequence at the 5′ end of the genome guided by complementarity of the TRS-B to the leader TRS (TRS-L). Many pieces of evidence currently support this model, including the presence of anti-leader sequence at the 3′ end of the negative-strand sub-genomic RNAs [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">
        38
       </xref>
       ]. However, many questions remain to fully define the model. For instance, how does the RdRp bypass all of the TRS-B sequences to produce full-length negative-strand genomic RNA? Also, how are the TRS-B sequences directed to the TRS-L and how much complementarity is necessary [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">
        49
       </xref>
       ]? Answers to these questions and others will be necessary to gain a full perspective of how RNA replication occurs in coronaviruses.
      </p>
      <p id="Par19">
       Finally, coronaviruses are also known for their ability to recombine using both homologous and nonhomologous recombination [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">
        50
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">
        51
       </xref>
       ]. The ability of these viruses to recombine is tied to the strand switching ability of the RdRp. Recombination likely plays a prominent role in viral evolution and is the basis for targeted RNA recombination, a reverse genetics tool used to engineer viral recombinants at the 3′ end of the genome.

       Assembly and Release
      </title>
      <p id="Par20">
       Following replication and sub-genomic RNA synthesis, the viral structural proteins, S, E, and M are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These proteins move along the secretory pathway into the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">
        52
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">
        53
       </xref>
       ]. There, viral genomes encapsidated by N protein bud into membranes of the ERGIC containing viral structural proteins, forming mature virions [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">
        54
       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p id="Par21">
       The M protein directs most protein–protein interactions required for assembly of coronaviruses. However, M protein is not sufficient for virion formation, as virus-like particles (VLPs) cannot be formed by M protein expression alone. When M protein is expressed along with E protein VLPs are formed, suggesting these two proteins function together to produce coronavirus envelopes [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">
        55
       </xref>
       ]. N protein enhances VLP formation, suggesting that fusion of encapsidated genomes into the ERGIC enhances viral envelopment [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">
        56
       </xref>
       ]. The S protein is incorporated into virions at this step, but is not required for assembly. The ability of the S protein to traffic to the ERGIC and interact with the M protein is critical for its incorporation into virions.
      </p>
      <p id="Par22">
       While the M protein is relatively abundant, the E protein is only present in small quantities in the virion. Thus, it is likely that M protein interactions provide the impetus for envelope maturation. It is unknown how E protein assists M protein in assembly of the virion, and several possibilities have been suggested. Some work has indicated a role for the E protein in inducing membrane curvature [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">

       –
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">

       ], although others have suggested that E protein prevents the aggregation of M protein [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">
        60
       </xref>
       ]. The E protein may also have a separate role in promoting viral release by altering the host secretory pathway [

       The M protein also binds to the nucleocapsid, and this interaction promotes the completion of virion assembly. These interactions have been mapped to the C-terminus of the endodomain of M with CTD of the N-protein [

Another outstanding question is how the N protein selectively packages only positive-sense full-length genomes among the many different RNA species produced during infection. A packaging signal for MHV has been identified in the nsp15 coding sequence, but mutation of this signal does not appear to affect virus production, and a mechanism for how this packaging signal works has not been determined [

       Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis. It is not known if the virions use the traditional pathway for transport of large cargo from the Golgi or if the virus has diverted a separate, unique pathway for its own exit. In several coronaviruses, S protein that does not get assembled into virions transits to the cell surface where it mediates cell–cell fusion between infected cells and adjacent, uninfected cells. This leads to the formation of giant, multinucleated cells, which allows the virus to spread within an infected organism without being detected or neutralized by virus-specific antibodies.

       Animal Coronaviruses

       Coronaviruses cause a large variety of diseases in animals, and their ability to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals such as pigs, cows, chickens, dogs, and cats led to significant research on these viruses in the last half of the twentieth century. For instance, Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets, leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and ultimately economic losses. PEDV recently emerged in North America for the first time, causing significant losses of young piglets. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) mostly leads to enteric infection but has the ability to infect the nervous system, causing encephalitis, vomiting, and wasting in pigs. Feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in domestic cats, but during persistent infection, mutation transforms the virus into a highly virulent strain of FCoV, Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), that leads to development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP has wet and dry forms, with similarities to the human disease, sarcoidosis. FIPV is macrophage tropic and it is believed that it causes aberrant cytokine and/or chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, resulting in lethal disease [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">
        63
       </xref>
       ]. However, additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Bovine CoV, Rat CoV, and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections in cattle, rats, and chickens, respectively. Bovine CoV causes significant losses in the cattle industry and also has spread to infect a variety of ruminants, including elk, deer, and camels. In addition to severe respiratory disease, the virus causes diarrhea (“winter dysentery” and “shipping fever”), all leading to weight loss, dehydration, decreased milk production, and depression [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">
        63
       </xref>
       ]. Some strains of IBV, a γ-coronavirus, also affect the urogenital tract of chickens causing renal disease. Infection of the reproductive tract with IBV significantly diminishes egg production, causing substantial losses in the egg-production industry each year [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">
        63

       ]. More recently, a novel coronavirus named SW1 has been identified in a deceased Beluga whale [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">
        64
       </xref>
       ]. Large numbers of virus particles were identified in the liver of the deceased whale with respiratory disease and acute liver failure. Although, electron microscopic images were not sufficient to identify the virus as a coronavirus, sequencing of the liver tissue clearly identified the virus as a coronavirus. It was subsequently determined to be a γ-coronavirus based on phylogenetic analysis but it has not yet been verified experimentally that this virus is actually a causative agent of disease in whales. In addition, there has been intense interest in identifying novel bat CoVs, since these are the likely ancestors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified over the past decade [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">

        Mesoniviridae

Interestingly, these viruses do not encode for an endoribonuclease, which is present in all other nidoviruses. These attributes suggest these viruses are the prototype of a new nidovirus family and may be a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.

       The most heavily studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which causes a variety of outcomes in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections. These infections often serve as highly useful models of disease. For instance, MHV-1 causes severe respiratory disease in susceptible A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, A59 and MHV-3 induce severe hepatitis, while JHMV causes severe encephalitis. Interestingly, MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade [

       ]. Most notably, A59 and attenuated versions of JHMV cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), making MHV infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease. Early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord [

       </xref>
       ], although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin. Finally, MHV can be studied under BSL2 laboratory conditions, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which require a BSL3 laboratory, and provides a large number of suitable animal models. These factors make MHV an ideal model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses.

       Human Coronaviruses

      <p id="Par27">
       Prior to the SARS-CoV outbreak, coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild, self-limiting respiratory infections in humans. Two of these human coronaviruses are α-coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, while the other two are β-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were isolated nearly 50 years ago [

       ]. These viruses are endemic in the human populations, causing 15–30 % of respiratory tract infections each year. They cause more severe disease in neonates, the elderly, and in individuals with underlying illnesses, with a greater incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in these populations. HCoV-NL63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis (croup) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">
        79
       </xref>
       ]. One interesting aspect of these viruses is their differences in tolerance to genetic variability. HCoV-229E isolates from around the world have only minimal sequence divergence [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">
        80

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">
        81
       </xref>
       ]. This likely explains the inability of HCoV-229E to cross the species barrier to infect mice while HCoV-OC43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus, BCoV, are capable of infecting mice and several ruminant species. Based on the ability of MHV to cause demyelinating disease, it has been suggested that human CoVs may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, no evidence to date suggests that human CoVs play a significant role in MS.

       SARS-CoV, a group 2b β-coronavirus, was identified as the causative agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred in 2002–2003 in the Guangdong Province of China. It is the most severe human disease caused by any coronavirus. During the 2002–2003 outbreak approximately 8,098 cases occurred with 774 deaths, resulting in a mortality rate of 9 %. This rate was much higher in elderly individuals, with mortality rates approaching 50 % in individuals over 60 years of age. Furthermore, the outbreak resulted in the loss of nearly $40 billion dollars in economic activity, as the virus nearly shut down many activities in Southeast Asia and Toronto, Canada for several months. The outbreak began in a hotel in Hong Kong and ultimately spread to more than two dozen countries. During the epidemic, closely related viruses were isolated from several exotic animals including Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs [

        85

Although some human individuals within wet animal markets had serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection prior to the outbreak, these individuals had no apparent symptoms [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">

       ], except in a few cases of superspreading events where one individual was able to infect multiple contacts due to an enhanced development of high viral burdens or ability to aerosolize virus. As a result of the relatively inefficient transmission of SARS-CoV, the outbreak was controllable through the use of quarantining. Only a small number of SARS cases occurred after the outbreak was controlled in June 2003.

However, the outbreak did not accelerate in 2013, although sporadic cases continued throughout the rest of the year. In April 2014, a spike of over 200 cases and almost 40 deaths occurred, prompting fears that the virus had mutated and was more capable of human-to-human transmission. More likely, the increased number of cases resulted from improved detection and reporting methods combined with a seasonal increase in birthing camels.

      In most cases of self-limited infection, diagnosis of coronaviruses is unnecessary, as the disease will naturally run its course. However, it may be important in certain clinical and veterinary settings or in epidemiological studies to identify an etiological agent. Diagnosis is also important in locations where a severe CoV outbreak is occurring, such as, at present, in the Middle East, where MERS-CoV continues to circulate. The identification of cases will guide the development of public health measures to control outbreaks. It is also important to diagnose cases of severe veterinary CoV-induced disease, such as PEDV and IBV, to control these pathogens and protect food supplies. RT-PCR has become the method of choice for diagnosis of human CoV, as multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed, are able to detect all four respiratory HCoVs and could be further adapted to novel CoVs [

      Only limited options are available to prevent coronavirus infections. Vaccines have only been approved for IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, but these vaccines are not always used because they are either not very effective, or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic CoVs via recombination of circulating strains. Vaccines for veterinary pathogens, such as PEDV, may be useful in such cases where spread of the virus to a new location could lead to severe losses of veterinary animals. In the case of SARS-CoV, several potential vaccines have been developed but none are yet approved for use. These vaccines include recombinant attenuated viruses, live virus vectors, or individual viral proteins expressed from DNA plasmids. Therapeutic SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies have been generated and could be retrieved and used again in the event of another SARS-CoV outbreak. Such antibodies would be most useful for protecting healthcare workers. In general, it is thought that live attenuated vaccines would be the most efficacious in targeting coronaviruses. This was illustrated in the case of TGEV, where an attenuated variant, PRCV, appeared in Europe in the 1980s. This variant only caused mild disease and completely protected swine from TGEV.

      Future research on coronaviruses will continue to investigate many aspects of viral replication and pathogenesis. First, understanding the propensity of these viruses to jump between species, to establish infection in a new host, and to identify significant reservoirs of coronaviruses will dramatically aid in our ability to predict when and where potential epidemics may occur. As bats seem to be a significant reservoir for these viruses, it will be interesting to determine how they seem to avoid clinically evident disease and become persistently infected. Second, many of the non-structural and accessory proteins encoded by these viruses remain uncharacterized with no known function, and it will be important to identify mechanisms of action for these proteins as well as defining their role in viral replication and pathogenesis. These studies should lead to a large increase in the number of suitable therapeutic targets to combat infections. Furthermore, many of the unique enzymes encoded by coronaviruses, such as ADP-ribose-1″-phosphatase, are also present in higher eukaryotes, making their study relevant to understanding general aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry. Third, gaining a complete picture of the intricacies of the RTC will provide a framework for understanding the unique RNA replication process used by these viruses. Finally, defining the mechanism of how coronaviruses cause disease and understanding the host immunopathological response will significantly improve our ability to design vaccines and reduce disease burden.

         Objective
        </title>
        <p>
         CDC routinely conducts contact investigations involving travelers on commercial conveyances, such as aircrafts, cargo vessels, and cruise ships.

         Methods
        </title>
        <p>
         The agency used established systems of communication and partnerships with other federal agencies to quickly provide accurate traveler contact information to states and jurisdictions to alert contacts of potential exposure to two travelers with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) who had entered the United States on commercial flights in April and May 2014.

         Results
        </title>
        <p>
         Applying the same process used to trace and notify travelers during routine investigations, such as those for tuberculosis or measles, CDC was able to notify most travelers of their potential exposure to MERS-CoV during the first few days of each investigation.

         Conclusion
        </title>
        <p>
         To prevent the introduction and spread of newly emerging infectious diseases, travelers need to be located and contacted quickly.

        Quarantine for SARS during the 2003 Taiwan outbreak expedited case detection, thereby indirectly preventing infections.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        During the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan, &gt;150,000 persons were quarantined, 24 of whom were later found to have laboratory-confirmed SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Since no evidence exists that SARS-CoV is infective before the onset of symptoms and the quarantined persons were exposed but not symptomatic, we thought the quarantine's effectiveness should be investigated. Using the Taiwan quarantine data, we found that the onset-to-diagnosis time of previously quarantined confirmed case-patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been quarantined. Thus, quarantine for SARS in Taiwan screened potentially infective persons for swift diagnosis and hospitalization after onset, thereby indirectly reducing infections. Full-scale quarantine measures implemented on April 28 led to a significant improvement in onset-to-diagnosis time of all SARS patients, regardless of previous quarantine status. We discuss the temporal effects of quarantine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential usefulness of quarantine in faster identification of persons with SARS and in improving isolation measures.

     The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic from November 2002 to June 2003 came with much public attention and left swiftly, resulting in &gt;8,000 probable cases worldwide and 774 deaths (

     ). Prominent among retrospective analyses is the belief that the simple ancient system of placing persons suspected of being infected under quarantine was instrumental in the quick containment of the outbreak (

     ). However, questions persist regarding how quarantine worked to control this disease, given the time-tested axiom that quarantine is most useful only when patients are infectious before becoming symptomatic, thus directly preventing secondary infections (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">
      <italic>
       6
      </italic>
     </xref>
     ). Moreover, due to early confusion resulting from imprecise clinical diagnosis and case definition (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">
      <italic>
       7
      </italic>
     </xref>
     ), correct clinical diagnosis and prompt isolation were often impossible, which resulted in insufficient isolation and gaps in the containment strategy for hospital infection control (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">
      <italic>
       8
      </italic>
     </xref>
     ). Since all available evidence indicates that SARS patients were only infectious after symptom onset (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">
      <italic>
       9
      </italic>
     </xref>
     ), one may argue that quarantine provides a window of several days during which illnesses can be diagnosed swiftly and persons isolated accordingly. In this study, we used data from the Taiwan SARS outbreak to explore whether quarantine was effective in expediting the time from onset to clinical diagnosis and hospitalization, and the time from clinical diagnosis to classification as a probable case-patient, thus contributing indirectly to prevention of possible infections.

       During the outbreak of 2003, 346 SARS cases were officially confirmed in Taiwan, among which were 37 direct SARS deaths (cause of death was recorded as SARS) and 36 SARS-related deaths (cause of death was not directly attributed to SARS) as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) (

       ). To guard against the potential threat of a large-scale epidemic, the government attempted to place &gt;150,000 people under home quarantine. Two distinct levels of quarantine were implemented in Taiwan. Level A quarantine, aimed at people having close contact with a suspected SARS case-patient, was implemented on March 18, 2003. Level B quarantine, aimed at travelers from affected areas, was implemented on April 28, in the aftermath of the first SARS death on April 26 (

       ). Most of the quarantined persons were confined to their homes for 10–14 days. Public health nurses would bring the quarantined persons 3 meals every day and sometimes helped them with odd jobs such as washing clothes or taking care of pets. Center for Disease Control–Taiwan officially confirmed 346 SARS-CoV–positive cases, of which 17 case-patients had been previously quarantined; 134 additional laboratory-confirmed, antibody-positive SARS cases occurred, of which 7 case-patients had previously been quarantined. The total number of confirmed SARS case-patients in Taiwan by the end of December 2004 was 480, of which 24 had been quarantined previously. Details regarding the persons quarantined during the SARS outbreak are itemized in

       The 134 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS either had milder symptoms and SARS was therefore clinically diagnosed as suspected cases, ruled out at the time of the outbreak, or considered probable in patients whose specimens had previously tested negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or anti–SARS-CoV antibody, perhaps due to wrong timing, but later were reconfirmed by &gt;2 different laboratory tests in a follow-up epidemiologic study. Seven people in this group had been previously quarantined. Our criterion for a quarantined person was someone who had been placed under official quarantine for &gt;1 day before the onset of symptoms. Thus, persons in whom symptoms developed on the same date or before the notification of quarantine were considered not quarantined and were therefore excluded. Persons who were known to have had a record of close contacts with others during the supposed quarantine period were also excluded. One of the 24 case-patients actually had an imported case but was quarantined before implementation of level B quarantine on April 28 for reasons other than simply being a traveler from an affected area.

       Statistical Analyses
      </title>
      <p>
       We compared the mean time from onset of symptoms to clinical diagnosis (and admission) for the 24 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV who had been quarantined before symptom onset to that of the 451 SARS-CoV–positive case-patients who had not. Note that 5 cases were deleted from the data of 480 total cases for our comparison test because of missing information on their relevant dates. (We will use the term "diagnosis" to mean clinical diagnosis hereafter). For the mean time from diagnosis to classification as probable case, we only used the officially confirmed cases for comparison, since the laboratory-confirmed cases were either ruled out or classified as suspected cases only and thus had no classification of probable time. Again, 2 of these cases were deleted from the data for our comparison test due to missing information on their relevant dates; therefore, 344 case-patients (17 quarantined and 327 nonquarantined) were used. Due to the skewed data, we used the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.

      <p>
       To investigate the effect of large-scale quarantine on the changes in the efficiency of the public health system to identify SARS patients for isolation, we considered the temporal effect of important events for intervention and control of SARS in Taiwan. On April 28, level B quarantine was implemented, which marked the start of large-scale home quarantine (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       A second important date in SARS prevention and control was May 10, when changes in the review and classification procedures were implemented by the cabinet-level SARS Prevention and Extrication Committee in Taiwan to expedite the review and classification of SARS cases (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">
        <italic>
         13
        </italic>
       </xref>
       ). Before May 9, the relevant medical records (including any available laboratory test results) of all reported SARS patients were reviewed by a central SARS Advisory Committee of the Center for Disease Control–Taiwan in Taipei. Due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases caused by the hospital cluster outbreaks in Taipei in late April, the SARS Advisory Committee in CDC-Taiwan could not handle the rapidly increasing caseload. Consequently, after May 10, 3 regional offices of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in northern, central, and southern Taiwan took over the responsibility of case review. Local SARS expert committees were established in the 3 regions with each committee consisting of specialists similar to the central committee in Taipei. The experiences and the standard operation procedures of case review and case classification used by the central committee were transferred to the 3 regional SARS expert committees in the Bureau of National Health Insurance through several consensus meetings (

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       We used the Mann-Whitney test to compare the time intervals from onset to clinical diagnosis of SARS symptoms of confirmed SARS-CoV case-patients with onset occurring during the 3 periods of February 25–April 27 (period 1), April 28–May 9 (period 2), and May 10–June 15 (period 3). Five patients were deleted from the data for our comparison test due to missing information on their relevant dates, and 2 patients were deleted because their onsets of SARS did not occur during the 3 time periods.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also compared, using the Mann-Whitney test, the intervals from diagnosis to classification as probable SARS of the 343 officially confirmed SARS-CoV case-patients (by dividing the cases into 3 groups, according to the time period in which the date of diagnosis occurred). Again, the laboratory-confirmed cases had never been classified as probable cases. Moreover, 2 cases were deleted from the data for our comparison test due to missing information on their relevant dates, and 1 case was deleted because classification as a probable case-patient did not occur during the 3 periods from February 25 to June 15.

      The mean time from onset to diagnosis for the previously quarantined persons (1.20 days) was significantly shorter than that of those who were not quarantined (2.89 days) (

For the mean onset-to-diagnosis time, period 1 was significantly longer (3.60 days to 2.49 days) than period 2 (p &lt; 0.0001), while the mean difference before and after May 10 was not significant (p = 0.0722) (

      Discussion and Conclusions
     </title>
     <p>
      The experience in the affected areas has shown that the transmission of SARS can be prevented by adherence to basic public health measures, including rapid case detection, isolation of patients with suspected and probable cases, contact tracing, and good infection control (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">
       <italic>
        9
       </italic>
      </xref>
      ). The effect of possible delays in effective isolation of probable case-patients has been studied in some modeling work on SARS (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">
       <italic>
        15
       </italic>

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">

      ). In Taiwan, all patients were supposed to be placed in the isolation room and negative pressure room, if available, as soon as they were reported as having probable or suspected SARS. For most of May, the number of suspected case-patients alone remained well above 1,000, partly because of confusion in diagnosis and the tendency to overdiagnosis because of heightened alertness on the part of physicians and legal punishment for underreporting. At times, however, due to the lack of available isolation rooms or the number of suspected cases pending review, patients with suspected but unconfirmed SARS were kept for days in an observation room or emergency department under crude isolation, where nosocomial infections readily occurred. At other times, patients scheduled to transfer to another hospital with negative pressure isolation rooms were temporarily kept in the observation room in the emergency department where nosocomial infections might occur because of insufficient isolation and protection procedures (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">
       <italic>
        18
       </italic>
      </xref>
      ). When full isolation facilities were not available to all patients, those classified as probable SARS case-patients likely received higher priority and were observed more closely during their isolation by healthcare workers than were the suspected case-patients.
     </p>
     <p>
      For some case-patients, delays occurred because of the patient's uncertain status or urgent need for intubation without comprehensive information on the patient's contact and clinical history; these delays led to insufficient protection and isolation. One well-known case-patient was the index patient at Hoping Hospital in Taipei, where the largest cluster infection in Taiwan occurred. Her condition was diagnosed and reported as suspected SARS on April 9. However, because the patient had no apparent contact with another known SARS case-patient, her case was reviewed but not reclassified as probable until April 25, by which time the clustered cases, which included medical staff members and an x-ray technician who had contact with her, had already forced the hospital to shut down on the previous day. More strict infection control would have been in place had the index patient been confirmed as a probable SARS patient. Several other similar cases occurred in Taiwan, some more than 1 month later. Therefore the importance of rapid classification as probable case-patients cannot be ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our results show that quarantine reduced the time from onset to diagnosis but did not significantly reduce the time from diagnosis to classification. Thus, a previously quarantined person could expect his or her condition to be diagnosed and to be hospitalized more quickly once clinical symptoms appeared. However the same person would not receive higher priority in the classification process to determine candidates for effective isolation. Nevertheless, in many hospitals with available isolation rooms, patients with suspected cases were effectively isolated as soon as chest radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome became available. Moreover, in the latter stages of the epidemic when a reliable laboratory test for SARS-CoV became more available, many patients were isolated in negative pressure chambers immediately if results of reverse transcription–PCR for SARS-CoV from 2 different laboratories were positive. Therefore, the effect of classification as a probable case-patient might not be as pronounced as it would have been otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      For all laboratory-confirmed case-patients, regardless of whether they were quarantined previously, the implementation of full-scale intervention measures, including level B quarantine on April 28, significantly decreased the time from onset to diagnosis, but it only slightly improved the time from diagnosis to classification. However, the small sample size of 24 previously quarantined SARS case-patients did not permit a meaningful test of whether a significant difference existed for the previously quarantined persons during each of the 3 periods.
     </p>
     <p>
      By comparison, the change in the review and classification procedure initiated on May 10 helped shorten the diagnosis-to-classification time for all SARS patients, indicating that the action by the SARS Prevention and Extrication Committee to expedite the review process had indeed worked. However, by separating the analyses of data into discrete epochs marked by significant events, we have included those cases whose illnesses straddle epochs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the future, when facing newly emerging infectious diseases like SARS, in which the patient's infectivity in the incubation period is unknown, precise clinical diagnosis cannot be made, and modes of transmission are uncertain, quarantine should be used not only to directly prevent possible asymptomatic infections but also to screen out potentially infective persons to swiftly prevent secondary or even tertiary infections after the symptoms appear.
     </p>
     <p>
      The quarantine in Taiwan was indeed useful in helping to identify persons who are likely to develop symptoms and isolate them more quickly if and when they did, although its effect on isolation and infection control could perhaps be improved by quicker classification or confirmation of previously quarantined patients. No conclusion was drawn regarding whether better outbreak control would be achieved by placing fewer persons in quarantine or by concentrating on improving the efficiency of detection and isolation procedures. In fact, each area may be improved in efficiency without jeopardizing the other's improvement.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        The first ever case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported in September 2012. This report describes the approaches taken by CDC, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners, to respond to this novel virus, and outlines the agency responses prior to the first case appearing in the United States in May 2014. During this time, CDC's response integrated multiple disciplines and was divided into three distinct phases: before, during, and after the initial activation of its Emergency Operations Center. CDC's response to MERS-CoV required a large effort, deploying at least 353 staff members who worked in the areas of surveillance, laboratory capacity, infection control guidance, and travelers' health. This response built on CDC's experience with previous outbreaks of other pathogens and provided useful lessons for future emerging threats.

     Since mid-March 2014, the frequency with which cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported has increased, with the majority of recent cases reported from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition, the frequency with which travel-associated MERS cases have been reported and the number of countries that have reported them to the World Health Organization (WHO) have also increased. The first case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was reported to CDC by the Indiana State Department of Health on May 1, 2014, and confirmed by CDC on May 2. A second imported case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler from Saudi Arabia having no connection with the first case, was reported to CDC by the Florida Department of Health on May 11, 2014. The purpose of this report is to alert clinicians, health officials, and others to increase awareness of the need to consider MERS-CoV infection in persons who have recently traveled from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula.

     cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by WHO (
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-431-436">
      Figure 1
     </xref>
     ). This includes 145 deaths. All reported cases have been directly or indirectly linked through travel or residence to seven countries: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, and Yemen (
     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-431-436">
      Figure 2
     </xref>
     ). Public health investigations are ongoing to determine the reason for the increase in cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     The median age of persons with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection is 49 years (range = &lt;1–94 years); 346 (65%) cases are in males, and 104 (19%) occurred in health-care workers. Although 62% of cases involved severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, 32 (5%) occurred in persons who had mild symptoms or illness not requiring hospitalization and 110 (21%) were asymptomatic, generally as a result of contact investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Countries outside the Arabian Peninsula with travel-associated MERS cases reported by WHO include the United Kingdom (UK), France, Tunisia, and Italy, where cases were reported in 2013(

     <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-431-436">
      Figure 2
     </xref>
     ). The travel-associated MERS cases reported by countries outside the Arabian Peninsula in 2014 occurred in persons with residence in or travel to Saudi Arabia. In addition, cases have occurred among travelers from Saudi Arabia to UAE and Jordan. Malaysia reported a case on April 17, 2014, in a man aged 54 years with underlying health problems. He had traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, visited a camel farm and consumed camel milk during his trip. He sought treatment in Malaysia on April 7 and died on April 13. Greece reported a case on April 18, 2014, in a male Greek citizen aged 69 years residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who traveled to Greece on April 17. His source of infection remains unclear. During the 14 days before onset of illness, he had extensive contact with a family member who was hospitalized in Jeddah but not with MERS-CoV infection. Egypt reported a case in a male aged 27 years who had been living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for the past 4 years and returned to Egypt on April 25. He had contact with two persons with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. The UAE Ministry of Health reported a case on March 30, 2014, in a male aged 64 years who had traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he visited a camel farm. A case of MERS was reported by Jordan on April 22, 2014, in a male aged 25 years from Saudi Arabia. He had a family member in Saudi Arabia who was previously reported by WHO as having MERS.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first case of MERS in the United States was reported to CDC by the Indiana State Department of Health on May 1, 2014, and confirmed by CDC on May 2. The case involved a male U.S. citizen aged ≥60 years who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia in a hospital in which patients with MERS had received care. He began feeling unwell on or around April 18 with a low-grade fever and myalgia without any respiratory symptoms. He traveled by commercial airlines from Saudi Arabia to Chicago, Illinois, on April 24, 2014, and then traveled by bus from Chicago to his destination in Indiana. On April 27, he developed shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, increasing fever, and rhinorrhea. On April 28, he was evaluated at and admitted to a hospital in Indiana. A chest radiograph revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate; chest computed tomography scan revealed bilateral lung infiltrates. The patient required supplemental oxygen, but did not require mechanical ventilation. On May 9, the patient was no longer symptomatic and health officials verified that the patient had tested negative for MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in two sets of sputum, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, and serum specimens collected on different days; the patient was considered to be fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before implementation of contact and airborne infection control precautions at the hospital in Indiana, 53 health-care personnel (HCP) had contact with the patient. Household contacts (who were assumed to be exposed), a community contact (a business associate in Cook County, Illinois, with whom the patient had extended face-to-face contact on April 25), and exposed HCP were asked to monitor themselves twice daily for symptoms and fever for 14 days after exposure, the period in which symptoms of MERS would be expected to appear. Household contacts and exposed HCP were recommended to wear a mask when outside of the house or in contact with other household members while on voluntary home quarantine
     <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-431-436">
      ¶
     </xref>
     for 14 days after contact. HCP who had unprotected close contact with the patient and were asymptomatic returned to work 14 days after the last exposure and confirmed negative laboratory results for MERS-CoV. Nasopharyngeal and serum specimens collected from all household, community, and HCP contacts have tested negative by PCR for MERS-CoV.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Indiana case involved a person who traveled on commercial flights between Saudi Arabia and the UK and between the UK and Chicago while he was symptomatic and potentially contagious. He then traveled for 70 minutes by bus from Chicago to his final destination in Indiana. For the two flights, the UK has jurisdiction for the flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK and the United States has jurisdiction for the flight from the UK to Chicago. Because little is known about the modes of transmission of MERS-CoV, CDC included all passengers and crew aboard the flight from the UK to Chicago and the bus in a contact investigation. Eighty airline passengers (including two who were also on the Saudi Arabia to UK flight) and 12 crew members were identified for follow-up from the flight between the UK and Chicago. As of May 12, 2014, a total of 58 airline passengers on the flight from the UK to Chicago have been contacted by CDC or state and local health departments; health authorities in other countries were notified about the other 22 passengers. Eight passengers on the Saudi Arabia to UK flight who later traveled to the United States have also been contacted. Four airline passengers on the flight from the UK to Chicago reported mild respiratory symptoms. Although these symptoms did not meet the case definition for a patient under investigation for MERS, to be especially cautious given the limited data on transmission of MERS-CoV, CDC and state health departments closely monitored the status of these four passengers for the duration of the 14 day incubation period. All airline crew were contacted and reported no symptoms. Nine passengers and a driver were on the bus that the affected person traveled on from Chicago to his final destination in Indiana. Five bus passengers and the bus driver were contacted and reported no illness. All airline and bus contacts were asked to monitor their body temperature twice daily and to report any fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or higher) or respiratory symptoms to their state or local health department until 14 days after the flight or bus trip.

    <p>
     A second imported case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler, was reported to CDC by the Florida Department of Health on May 11, 2014, and confirmed by CDC on May 11. The traveler, a health-care provider aged ≥40 years who resides and works in Saudi Arabia, is not linked to the case confirmed in Indiana. On May 1, the patient traveled by commercial airline from Saudi Arabia to the UK, the UK to Boston, Massachusetts; then Boston to Atlanta, Georgia; and then Atlanta to Orlando, Florida. The patient began feeling unwell during the flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK and continued to feel unwell on subsequent flights, with symptoms including myalgia, fever, chills, and a slight cough. He continued to have intermittent fevers, nausea, and severe myalgia during his time in Orlando, and on May 9, he went to a hospital emergency department. He was admitted to that hospital the same day to be evaluated for an acute viral syndrome. At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile. Public health and hospital officials have implemented infection control precautions (standard, contact, and airborne) at the hospital and are interviewing HCP who had close contact
     <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-431-436">

     </xref>
     with the patient and as well as household contacts to obtain detailed information on their exposures and monitor their health. CDC and state and local health departments are conducting airline contact tracing to identify and notify U.S. travelers who might have been exposed to this infected traveler.

     to analyze International Air Transport Association travel volume data for May and June from Saudi Arabia and UAE to North America for 2010–2012. This analysis showed that Cook County, which includes Chicago O’Hare airport, historically has the fourth highest volume of arriving travelers from Saudi Arabia and UAE for the months of May and June (

      Discussion
     </title>
     <p>
      This report describes the first two cases of MERS identified in the United States. These cases highlight the critical role that health-care providers play in considering a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in persons who develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Recent travelers might seek medical care distant from cities served by international air connections and all HCP need to be vigilant, including those outside of cities with the highest number of arriving travelers from the Arabian Peninsula. Health-care providers and health departments throughout the United States should be prepared to consider, detect, and manage cases of MERS.

       Evaluating patients
      </title>
      <p>
       CDC’s Interim Guidance for Health Professionals was updated on May 9, 2014, to include additional guidance on evaluation of patients and close contacts. Health-care professionals should evaluate for MERS-CoV infection in patients in the United States who meet the following criteria: A) fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiologic evidence) and either 1) a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset or 2) close contact with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, or 3) is a member of a cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) of unknown etiology in which MERS is being evaluated in consultation with a state or local health department; or B) close contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS while the affected person was ill. Additional guidance for health-care providers is available at
       <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html">
        http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html
       </ext-link>
       . Health-care providers should immediately report any person being evaluated for MERS-CoV infection who meets the criteria of a patient under investigation to their state or local health department. States will then notify CDC. Case definitions are available at

       Ill persons who are being evaluated for MERS and do not require hospitalization for medical reasons may be cared for and isolated in their home. Health-care providers should contact their state or local health department to determine whether home isolation or additional measures are indicated because recommendations might be modified as more data become available. Isolation is defined as the separation or restriction of activities of an ill person with a contagious disease from those who are well.

       Collecting and testing clinical specimens for MERS-CoV infection
      </title>
      <p>
       To increase the likelihood of detecting MERS-CoV infection, CDC recommends collecting multiple specimens from different sites at different times after symptom onset. For suspected MERS cases, health-care providers should collect the following specimens for submission to CDC or the appropriate public health laboratory: nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab (which can be placed in the same tube of viral transport medium as nasopharyngeal swabs), sputum, serum, and stool/rectal swab. In addition to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, collection of lower respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) is recommended because MERS-CoV infection has been confirmed in sputum of patients who tested negative by PCR for MERS-CoV in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. Personnel collecting specimens should wear recommended personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, gowns, eye protection, and respiratory protection), and recommended infection control precautions should be used when collecting specimens. Health-care providers should notify their state or local health departments if they suspect MERS-CoV infection in a person. State or local health departments should notify CDC of patients under investigation and any positive MERS-CoV test. Additional information is available at

       Travel guidance
      </title>
      <p>
       In response to the recent increase in cases of MERS in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula, CDC updated its advice for travelers. CDC’s travel notice has been upgraded to a Level 2 Alert,
       <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-431-436">
        §§
       </xref>
       which includes enhanced precautions for travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula who plan to work in health-care settings. These travelers should review CDC’s recommendations for infection control for confirmed or suspected MERS patients before they depart, practice these precautions while in the area, and monitor their health closely during and after their travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       CDC continues to recommend that all U.S. travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including MERS, by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. If travelers to the region have onset of fever with cough or shortness of breath during their trip or within 14 days of returning to the United States, they should seek medical care. They should call ahead to their health-care provider and mention their recent travel so that appropriate isolation measures can be taken in the health-care setting.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The level of transmission reduction required for physical distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a crucial question. We show that very high adherence to community quarantine (total stay-home policy) and a small household size is necessary for curbing the outbreak in a locked-down town. The larger the household size and amount of time in the public, the longer the lockdown period needed.

      European epicentre
     </title>
     <p>
      In February 2020, Italy became the epicentre for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Europe, with many exportations to other countries, and widespread community transmission, particularly in Northern Italy [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. As a public health response, on 22 February 2020, Italy imposed a lockdown with shutdown of businesses, schools and public places plus physical distancing in ‘hotspot’ regions close to Milan and Venice. Approximately 50,000 people could not enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for 14 days without special permission. The population sizes in these towns range from 927 to 15,293 individuals [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. As at 9 March 2020, 7,375 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 366 deaths had been observed in Italy, so on that date, the community quarantine was extended to include all of Northern Italy until 3 April. Here we aim to investigate the extent of physical distancing needed to effectively control the outbreak in a lockdown situation in a small size town setting typical of Italy. We specifically estimate the disease burden and the time required until the quarantine can be lifted, by taking into account the time spent by individuals in the public (i.e. outside of the home) and the household size.

      Stochastic individual based processes
     </title>
     <p>
      To account for the importance of stochasticity in individual-based processes within smaller cities and within households, we modelled the outbreak progression as a continuous-time Markov process, specifically by developing a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model in the form of a Master equation [

      ). The model was parameterised to COVID-19 based on published data on incubation time and infectious period [

      ,

      ]. We modelled a scenario where 0.1% of the population in the quarantined town would be in the latent period (i.e. the period of time between the point of infection and the onset of infectiousness) at the time of implementing the quarantine policy on 22 February, and that all symptomatic cases would have been moved out the locked-down town (e.g. placed in a hospital for care and isolation). This corresponds to five latent persons in a city of 5,000 persons. Further, we assumed that all persons were isolated after 1 day of symptoms. We also assumed a pre-symptomatic period of infectiousness of 1 day. Of all infected persons, we modelled different proportions of asymptomatic infections (scenarios of 10%, 20% or 50%) based on our preliminary knowledge on such proportions [

      Quarantine scenarios
     </title>
     <p>
      We modelled the effectiveness of quarantine based on the degree of adherence to quarantine, measured by the number of hours per person spent in the public per day. Complete noncompliance to community quarantine corresponds to a reference quarantine level, where individuals perform their every-day out-of-household activities (i.e. working, shopping, socialising) as normal, for an average 10 hours per day. Medium adherence to community quarantine restricts every-day out-of-household activities to 50% of normal, i.e. 5 hours a day. A complete community quarantine corresponds to no out-of-household activities at all, i.e. 0 hours a day. For any degree of quarantine adherence, we tested for four different average household sizes: (i) larger average households of six persons, (ii) medium average households of three persons, (iii) small average households of two persons, and lastly (iv) single-person households.

      Given that Italy had initially implemented a 14-days lockdown with community quarantine in several towns in Northern Italy, we estimated the number of secondary cases, including asymptomatic cases, in a town of 5,000 persons by the end of this time period in relation to the above scenarios (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">

These reported numbers relate to a population where 10% of all infected persons are asymptomatic, and would increase for 20% (

       Generally, higher adherence and smaller quarantine units help to minimise the number of (Panel A) secondary cases over the 14 days period, as well as (Panel B) latent and (Panel C) infectious cases at the end of a lockdown. This was shown for 10% asymptomatic cases. The same conclusion follows when also considering (Panels D–F) 20% asymptomatic cases and (Panels G–I) 50% asymptomatic cases. The number of cases, however, increases with the proportion of asymptomatic cases.

      Our model shows how the number of secondary cases within the town increases with the time spent in the public, and also with the average household size (i.e. the quarantine unit). Looking at the extremes, for a six-person household and no community quarantine, we predicted 43 new infections over the 14 days period. In contrast, for a single-person household and complete community quarantine (no time outside of homes), no secondary cases were predicted over the 14 days period. The average household size in Italy is 2.58 according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">
       12
      </xref>
      ]. For an average household size of two persons with complete, near-complete, medium and no community quarantine (i.e. 0, 1, 5, and 10 hours respectively in the community), we predict 3, 4, 7 and 11 secondary infections during the lockdown. With an average three-person household size, 7, 8, 12 and 20 secondary infections are predicted, respectively. The average Italian household size 2.58 is thus in-between that of a two-person and three-person household size. With a six-person average household size, 16, 19, 29 and 43 secondary infections would be predicted to occur over the 14-days period, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, our model indicates that the number of secondary, latent and infected cases has a linear relationship with the population size of a lockdown region, provided same population densities apply between cities. In a locked-down area with 50,000 people, we would expect for an average household size of two persons with complete, near-complete, medium and no community quarantine 30, 40, 70 and 110 secondary infections over the 14-days period, respectively.

      ), for a three-person average household-size situation, around 30 days will be a sufficient length under conditions of near-complete community quarantine adherence. With only medium adherence a duration of 54 days would be necessary. Less strict quarantine will result in much longer lockdown periods, which then become unfeasible for any society. These results are only marginally different to a situation with 50% asymptomatic cases (

      These findings have major implications. A lockdown is designed to reduce spread beyond the lockdown area, and to also prevent further importation into a lockdown area. In a lockdown area, all measures need to be taken to curb transmission. We showed that transmission will continue to occur unless the most stringent community quarantine measures are being taken in a lockdown setting, which means near-complete reduction of all activities in the community. We also find that smaller household sizes, or quarantine group sizes, are associated with fewer secondary cases. Our model results apply to any small-city population size, and can be generalised to larger towns and cities given the linear relationship between population size and secondary cases, assuming a similar population density. COVID-19 is driven by population densities [

       13
      </xref>
      ]. For settings with higher population densities, which facilitate more intermixing within the population, higher number of secondary cases are expected. The population density in urban Italy is 205.45/km

      [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">

      ]. We note that with near 100% restriction of outdoor activities, all transmission will continue to occur within households. In the event of an average household size of three individuals, this would mean that, as a result of within-household transmission, seven secondary cases would be expected (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
       Figure 1a
      </xref>
      ) in a population of 5,000 persons, or 70 secondary infections in a population of 50,000. Public health measures should be in place to immediately test and isolate infected persons.

       Quarantine in the wider context
      </title>
      <p>
       The lockdown in China with government enforced movement restriction outdoors combined with facility-based case isolation, rigorous contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts, had a substantial impact on interrupting the chain of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan, thus effectively containing the outbreak [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">
        16
       </xref>
       ]. While the outbreak in Wuhan involved a highly urbanised setting, the current lockdown in Italy involves small villages with a different social culture and behaviour, and different mechanisms of quarantine enforcement. Our findings suggest that the degree of quarantine adherence needs to be very high regardless of population size in order to be effective. We note, however, that a less strict community quarantine could still flatten the curve of the outbreak compared to no quarantine [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">
        17
       </xref>
       ]. In any case, quarantine adherence has an Important and notable impact on reducing the outbreak, but some transmission will still occur within households. We showed that in a theoretical scenario of a single-person household with very strict community quarantine measures, no secondary infections would occur. While a single-person household does not reflect the reality of any society, it does suggest that if all cases could be isolated, e.g. moved out of the community, the epidemic curve would decline much faster and the lockdown duration could be reduced. This means that more efforts need to be done at household level: keeping physical distance even within a household combined with wearing face masks and segregated within-household isolation, or better all symptomatic cases ideally need to be promptly moved out of the household, and isolated in a designated facility. Prompt testing is therefore needed for timely diagnosis and immediate isolation. We also show that a 14-days lockdown period is not sufficient for most scenarios; a longer lockdown duration is needed. On 8 March, Italy announced the need to extend the lockdown to include around 16 million people for 25 additional days until 3 April. Such longer duration should in fact be expected to be required, to have a positive impact, which is going to be very challenging for affected communities to be supplied in food, essential services and to be able to cope psychologically. If lockdown is enforced, it must be done rigorously to truly interrupt transmission, and this would mean near 100% restriction of contacts between persons within the community combined with prompt isolation of new cases. Less strict quarantine adherence would imply even longer lockdown periods, and longer lockdown periods will likely present even greater socioeconomic challenges. By implementing the world’s largest lockdown combined with prompt case isolation, contact tracing of contacts and with strict enforcement of physical distancing [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">
        16
       </xref>
       ], containment of COVID-19 in China was shown to be feasible. Remarkably, in South Korea, the control of the outbreak, which had been temporarily lost, was regained without lockdown but with rigorous active case finding, by liberal testing, prompt isolation, and by using novel digital technologies to maximise contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">
        18
       </xref>
       ]. In certain places like Taiwan [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">
        19
       </xref>
       ], Singapore [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">
        20
       </xref>
       ] and Hong Kong, a flat epidemic curve was maintained for COVID-19 by applying very liberal testing, prompt case isolation outside of the community (no home isolation even of the mildest cases), and technologically enhanced contact tracing, very early in the outbreak. If the lockdown in Italy, and meanwhile in many other European countries, is aimed at containment, close to 100% restriction of contact time within communities combined with prompt case detection and immediate isolation of infected persons need to be achieved.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        Due to their genetic relatedness, great apes are highly susceptible to common human respiratory pathogens. Although most respiratory pathogens, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rarely cause severe disease in healthy human adults, they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in wild great apes habituated to humans for research or tourism. To prevent pathogen transmission, most great ape projects have established a set of hygiene measures ranging from keeping a specific distance, to the use of surgical masks and establishment of quarantines. This study investigates the incidence of respiratory symptoms and human respiratory viruses in humans at a human‐great ape interface, the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in Côte d'Ivoire, and consequently, the effectiveness of a 5‐day quarantine designed to reduce the risk of potential exposure to human respiratory pathogens. To assess the impact of quarantine as a preventative measure, we monitored the quarantine process and tested 262 throat swabs for respiratory viruses, collected during quarantine over a period of 1 year. Although only 1 subject tested positive for a respiratory virus (HRSV), 17 subjects developed symptoms of infection while in quarantine and were subsequently kept from approaching the chimpanzees, preventing potential exposure in 18 cases. Our results suggest that quarantine—in combination with monitoring for symptoms—is effective in reducing the risk of potential pathogen exposure. This research contributes to our understanding of how endangered great apes can be protected from human‐borne infectious disease.

      INTRODUCTION
     </title>
     <p>
      In 1979, primatologists Christophe Boesch and Hedwige Boesch‐Achermann instituted one of the first long‐term field studies of chimpanzees: the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) situated in Côte d'Ivoire's Taï National Park. They set out to habituate chimpanzees—to accustom them to human presence—in order to study their behavior (Boesch &amp; Boesch‐Achermann,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0002">
       2000
      </xref>
      ). Their work has significantly contributed to our understanding of chimpanzee culture and cognition as well as human evolution. Moreover, Boesch and Boesch‐Achermann made important observations on illness, on the disappearance of individual chimpanzees, and obtained biological samples that paved the way for future investigations of disease (Boesch,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0003">
       2008
      </xref>
      ; Leendertz et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0024">
       2006
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      These later investigations have led to the identification of numerous pathogens. Not only do they account for pathogens occurring naturally in the chimpanzees (e.g., STLV and SFV) and in the habitat (e.g., Ebola and
      <italic>
       Bacillus cereus bv anthracis
      </italic>
      ), but also those introduced by humans, such as the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (Boesch,

      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 1999, TCP experienced at least six major respiratory disease outbreaks of human origin and with losses of up to 19% of the chimpanzee communities (Köndgen et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0018">
       2008
      </xref>
      ). Other projects have also published data on human respiratory pathogens infecting and, ultimately, killing several wild, habituated great apes (Grützmacher et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0015">
       2016
      </xref>
      ; Kaur et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0017">
       2008
      </xref>
      ; Palacios et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0031">
       2011
      </xref>
      ). Such findings emphasize the inherent risk of proximity. In all of the reported outbreaks, the viruses detected were either HRSV or HMPV: two common human paramyxoviruses that generally cause only mild symptoms in healthy human adults (Falsey and Walsh,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0009">
       2000
      </xref>
      ; Webe, Mulholland, &amp; Greenwood,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0040">
       1998
      </xref>
      ). People can easily be unaware of their infectiousness because they may still feel physically fit enough to visit the great apes. In short, the risk of transmission is often overlooked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the issue of whether humans should interfere with naturally occurring disease outbreaks in protected species is controversial, it is commonly understood that disease transmission from humans should be mitigated (Gilardi et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0012">
       2015
      </xref>
      ). It is the ethical responsibility of humans entering great ape habitats to help minimize the costs of habituation, including potential changes in behavior, alterations of the habitat, and the sickness and loss of individuals. Indeed, since 1992, the TCP has gradually implemented preventative steps to reduce the risk of exposing chimpanzees to human pathogens. The first steps included rules not to enter the forest when ill and to remove all garbage. Two years later, additional rules to bury human feces and to bring back all food remains from the forest were established and complemented by veterinary collaboration. In 1999, a minimum viewing distance of 5 m was implemented (later extended to 7 m) alongside requirements that all humans be vaccinated against yellow fever, tuberculosis, measles, and poliomyelitis. Vaccination against meningococcal disease was added in 2006. In addition to being under constant veterinary attendance since 2000, in 2002, the TCP installed a “hygiene barrier” outside the camps—clothes are changed, boots are disinfected whenever entering or leaving the forest, and human feces are carried back to camp. In 2004, preventive measures were once again strengthened. Spitting in the forest and family members in the camps became prohibited. And, simultaneously, the wearing of surgical masks became obligatory when in the presence of chimpanzees. The step toward quarantine was first taken in 2008. An 8‐day quarantine was introduced for travelers arriving in the country, wherein the last 3 days of quarantine were completed in the TCP camps (Boesch,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0003">
       2008
      </xref>
      ). Following the last major outbreak in 2009, the quarantine rules were adjusted to a 5‐day period of quarantine in a separate quarantine camp for all humans intending to visit the chimpanzees (Gilardi et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0012">
       2015
      </xref>
      ). Additionally, international travelers have to spend a minimum of 2 days in Côte d'Ivoire before entering quarantine.
     </p>
     <p>
      Researchers and field assistants alike now enter the quarantine on Day 1 (QD1). They must remain in a designated area in the quarantine camp without direct contact to people who have already cleared quarantine, anybody from the outside, or anybody in a different quarantine stage (the quarantine camp is divided into two separate sections to allow for two independent parties). After four nights, should no symptoms develop, the respective person clears quarantine on the 5th day (QD5). However, if any symptoms are detected, the person exits quarantine and starts over with QD1 after all symptoms have subsided. If anyone falls sick during quarantine, then everyone in quarantine at the same time also has to start over with QD1 (see Figure
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ajp22619-fig-0001">
       1
      </xref>
      ). However, 5 days do not cover the longest possible incubation periods—the time between infection and symptom onset—of most human respiratory pathogens (see Table
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="ajp22619-tbl-0001">
       1
      </xref>
      ). But, with the exception of measles (against which humans have to be vaccinated in order to visit habituated chimpanzees at TCP), at least 50% of this period is covered for all other relevant viruses. Against this backdrop, the goal of this study is to determine the number of humans falling ill during quarantine. Furthermore, the risk of potential exposure to human pathogens is assessed by testing sick humans to detect common human respiratory viruses they brought to the habituation site, and by randomly testing apparently healthy humans in the beginning and at the end of quarantine to assess the possibility of excreting HRSV and HMPV, the two most relevant viruses for wild great apes.

      METHODS
     </title>
     <p>
      The current study was performed at the TCP in Côte d'Ivoire. At the TCP, the quarantine camp is separate from the research camps with a designated kitchen, shower, and toilet. A driver supplies subjects in quarantine with food, wearing a facemask on delivery and leaving the food outside the building with no personal contact (for a more detailed description of quarantine protocols at TCP see Gilardi et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0012">
       2015
      </xref>
      ). When a subject falls ill, he or she is taken home to their village, or in case of international visitors (including researchers and film‐makers), the subject is physically separated within the quarantine facilities until symptoms cease and quarantine can begin again at QD1. If symptoms are more severe, subjects are taken to the local hospital for treatment. The staff health program of TCP includes yearly health checks at the local hospital, were a tuberculosis skin test and vaccinations against yellow fever, measles, poliomyelitis, and meningococcal disease are conducted. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and no animal samples were tested in this study. All study procedures were in compliance with the American Society of Primatologists’ Principles for the Ethical Treatment of Primates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over a period of 1 year (from August 2012 to August 2013), throat swabs were collected from all subjects (staff and researchers) entering the TCP and, thereby, quarantine. A total of 223 subjects entered quarantine during the year comprised of 67 international visitors and 156 local staff. When possible, samples were collected on both QD1 and QD5. In total, 262 were selected for testing. This sample selection was systematized to achieve an even seasonal distribution, wherein a minimum of 20 samples were tested for each month of the 1‐year research period, and to best assess the risk of potential pathogen exposure. Thus, the selection included 14 samples, collected from subjects with symptoms of illness (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 18) plus randomly selected subjects with corresponding samples from QD1 (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 110) and QD5 (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 101) (when possible), and samples from subjects tested on a different day of quarantine (due to various constraints) or who had been in contact with sick individuals (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 33). Signs of illness were generally mild respiratory symptoms, including sore throat, runny nose, or cough. Subjects in quarantine are expected to self‐report symptoms; however, the respective camp manager and “veterinarian in charge” also oversee the quarantine process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Swabs were stored and transported in liquid nitrogen and later kept in −80°C freezers. Three hundred microliters of nuclease‐free water were added to each sample and vortexed thoroughly before extraction. DNA/RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized with a Superscript Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and random hexamer primers (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany), and subsequently screened for HRSV and HMPV using generic PCR protocols as described by Reiche and Schweiger (
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0033">
       2009
      </xref>
      ) and Reiche et al. (
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0034">
       2014
      </xref>
      ), targeting the N or F protein gene, respectively, with expected amplicon sizes of 142 and 161 bp. Amplification was conducted for 5 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. Bands were cut from gel and extracted, if multiple bands occurred. Positive samples were purified using Exo‐SAP (USB Europe GmbH, Staufen, Germany) and sequenced, using the ABI Big Dye Termination Kit (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). qPCR positive samples were tested for confirmation with an additional hemi‐nested pan‐pneumovirus PCR assay, targeting the L protein gene as detailed by Tong, Chern, Li, Pallansch, and Anderson (
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0038">
       2008
      </xref>
      ). For individual confirmation of HRSV A and B, respectively, a hemi‐nested PCR was performed targeting the hypervariable region of the G protein gene as previously described by Sato et al. (
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0036">
       2005
      </xref>
      ); for confirmation of HMPV a hemi‐nested confirmation PCR was performed targeting the P protein gene, as described by Mackay et al. (
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0028">
       2004
      </xref>
      ). If samples from symptomatic individuals tested negative for HRSV and HMPV, then an array of PCR‐based screening assays were performed, targeting common human respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, influenza A and B, measles, parainfluenza, and rhinovirus (Chmielewicz, Nitsche, Schweiger, &amp; Ellerbrok,

      ). Positive samples were analyzed and sequenced as detailed above. All obtained sequences were compared to the non‐redundant nucleotide sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using BLAST. The sample was considered positive only when a sequence was obtained and identified via BLAST.

      RESULTS
     </title>
     <p>
      Eighteen (8%) of the 223 subjects who entered quarantine developed symptoms after their arrival to TCP. In 17 instances, subjects developed symptoms during quarantine and in a single instance after quarantine. International visitors (two of which had only recently arrived in Côte d'Ivoire) represented 7 (39%) and local staff represented 11 (61%) of symptomatic subjects. These subjects were subsequently sent back to the village or were isolated within camp until symptoms ceased. Illness occurred throughout the year with the exception of March, April, October, and December. The highest number of cases with illness (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 5) were observed in July (Dates of symptom occurrence: September 16, 22, and 23, November 8 and 28, 2012, January 8, two cases on February 3, May 20, June 8, two cases on July 6, July 8, and two cases on July 20, August 8, 21, and 31, 2013).
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the 262 samples tested, the 211 (80%) were samples from subjects entering quarantine on QD1 (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 110) or clearing quarantine on QD5 (
      <italic>
       N
      </italic>
      = 101). A total of 37 samples were taken on a different day of quarantine (i.e., QD2–QD8) due to constraints in the field, and originated from subjects who had been in contact with the subject testing positive for HRSV or in cases when quarantine was prolonged. The remaining 14 samples were obtained from the 18 subjects who developed symptoms. Only one of the samples from a subject with symptoms tested positive for HRSV (on November 8). In other words, no virus was found in 13 out of the 14 samples from symptomatic subjects. All samples taken from asymptomatic subjects tested negative for HRSV and HMPV.

      DISCUSSION
     </title>
     <p>
      Anthropogenic respiratory disease poses a serious risk to habituated wild great apes with high morbidity and considerable mortality (Boesch,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0003">
       2008
      </xref>
      ; Kaur et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0017">
       2008
      </xref>
      ; Köndgen et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0019">
       2010
      </xref>
      ; Leendertz et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0024">
       2006
      </xref>
      ; Palacios et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0031">
       2011
      </xref>
      ). Its mitigation is therefore, an ethical responsibility for habituation projects (Gruen, Fultz, &amp; Pruetz,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0014">
       2013
      </xref>
      ). However, preventing people from exposing wild habituated great apes to human pathogens is a challenge. In terms of potential pathogen exposure, both people from overseas who come to visit habituation sites as well as local staff on such projects routinely pose a risk to the health of wild great apes (Muehlenbein &amp; Ancrenaz,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0030">
       2009
      </xref>
      ). People who come to visit wild great apes from overseas are more likely to have been exposed to a variety of pathogens throughout their travel (e.g., in airports or airplanes) (Mangili &amp; Gendreau,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0029">
       2005
      </xref>
      ). Additionally, the stress of travel and changes in climate make them more susceptible to infection, leading to disease within few days after arrival at the destination where the great apes are encountered (Muehlenbein &amp; Ancrenaz,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0030">
       2009
      </xref>
      ). Despite these different risk factors, eco‐tourists frequently lack information about the relevance of their own health for the wildlife they intend to visit and, thus, may not take precautions or report illness (Muehlenbein &amp; Ancrenaz,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0030">
       2009
      </xref>
      ). Finally, local project staff can also pose an increased risk when they come into frequent contact with children in their villages—a subpopulation with high respiratory disease prevalence (Walker et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0039">
       2013
      </xref>
      ). The results show that international visitors represented 7 (39%) and local staff represented 11 (61%) of symptomatic subjects. However, only two of the seven international visitors became ill shortly after their arrival in Côte d'Ivoire and the remaining five rather mirror the health of permanent project staff in contact with the local diversity of pathogens.
     </p>
     <p>
      The detection of HRSV in only one out of 262 tested samples (including the 14 samples from people showing symptoms of respiratory disease) points toward a rather low prevalence of humans excreting HRSV and HMPV, when entering the TCP research area. Although the possibility of false‐negative results exists, it seems likely that if a person excretes these viruses in any relevant quantity—a quantity that would be sufficient for transmission to chimpanzees—it is likely to be detectable with the methods used here. Of course, the negative results for asymptomatic people are not surprising. For some respiratory viruses, however, pathogen excretion might start before the first symptoms occur. For example, 1–8% of influenza infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset (Lau et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0021">
       2010
      </xref>
      ). Cases of asymptomatic shedding have been reported for HRSV and HMPV—the most common causative agents of respiratory disease outbreaks in wild habituated great apes—but this is believed to be a rather rare occurrence (Falsey, Erdman, Anderson, &amp; Walsh,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0010">
       2003
      </xref>
      ). That said, HMPV has recently been reported at two different great ape field sites in 1 out of 24 and 1 out of 42 apparently healthy staff members (Grützmacher et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0015">
       2016
      </xref>
      ). Although asymptomatic infections must be taken into account as a risk factor, the absence of symptoms also limits the physical spread (e.g., the absence of cough or nasal discharge limit the excretion of the pathogen). Thus, strict hygiene rules should be sufficient to counteract the potential risk posed by apparently healthy people, especially those who have passed through quarantine.
     </p>
     <p>
      In this study, 13 subjects with respiratory symptoms (including cough, nasal discharge, or a sore throat) were negative for all viruses tested. That pathogens were not detected despite the observed symptoms may indicate that the symptoms were caused by viruses not included in our PCR panel or be due to the fact that symptoms do not always correlate well with viral particle excretion. These negative results can also be due to the detection limit of diagnostic methods (here PCR). Furthermore, symptoms indicating respiratory disease can be caused by primary or secondary bacterial infections, such as with
      <italic>
       Streptococcus pneumoniae
      </italic>
      . Importantly, despite their involvement in mortalities as secondary infections (Chi et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0007">
       2007
      </xref>
      ; Köndgen et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0020">
       2011
      </xref>
      ; Palacios et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0031">
       2011
      </xref>
      ), we did not test for potentially pathogenic bacteria. We did not do so mainly because such bacteria are often carried within the commensal flora of healthy humans, which makes it impossible to link a positive finding to the symptoms observed. This is a common problem for diagnostics in human medicine as well (Bartlett,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0001">
       2011
      </xref>
      ; Bosch, Biesbroek, Trzcinski, Sanders, &amp; Bogaert,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0004">
       2013
      </xref>
      ). Beyond viruses and bacteria, the most frequent causative agents for acute respiratory illness, certain parasites, or funguses are also capable of triggering symptoms. More generally, infectious agents are not the only cause of respiratory symptoms (Boutayeb,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0005">
       2006
      </xref>
      ). Non‐infectious etiologies include allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, air pollution, wildfire smoke, and smoking. While most of these causes are unlikely sources for the symptoms observed in this study–there was no particular air pollution or forest fire during the study period and neither allergies, asthma, nor any other chronic respiratory disease were reported by any of the subjects–it is impossible to entirely rule them out.
     </p>
     <p>
      From a practical point of view, however, preventing the spread of viruses is a bigger challenge because the particle size is smaller and aerosolization is more likely. Therefore, hygiene measures preventing viral spread will also likely prevent the transmission of bacterial pathogens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even though a causative pathogen could only be determined in a single case, the delays through quarantine led to development of symptoms within isolation in 17 cases. Without the quarantine procedure, these subjects would have already entered the forest, possibly approaching the chimpanzees and interacting with other people in the camps. Notably, the one incidence in which a person developed symptoms after clearing quarantine was the very same incidence where HRSV was found. Therefore, the infectious subject had not yet approached the chimpanzees and all contact persons were returned to quarantine. HRSV has a median incubation period of 4.4 days (95% CI: 3.9–4.9) and 95% of infected individuals will develop symptoms by 6.3 days (95% CI: 5.2–7.3) after infection (Lessler et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0027">
       2009
      </xref>
      ). While a 5‐day quarantine does not cover the complete incubation period, it does cover 71% of the HRSV incubation period (83% for HMPV), and thus, lowers the risk considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      Quarantine has rather high costs and is a time intensive measure, so length needs to be decided carefully. Extra space must also be made available to have physically separated facilities. Additionally, people are very limited in the work they can do while in quarantine and lose time that could otherwise be spent doing valuable fieldwork—which is expensive for the project. Yet, from a purely preventive health point of view, a 6‐day quarantine would be even better as it would cover 95% of people developing symptoms of HRSV, and 100% for HMPV—the only two viruses ever found in respiratory disease outbreaks among wild great apes (Kaur et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0017">
       2008
      </xref>
      ; Köndgen et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0019">
       2010
      </xref>
      ; Palacios et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0031">
       2011
      </xref>
      ). In addition, the challenging process of quarantine has the positive side effect of limiting exchanges with surrounding villages, which in itself lowers the risk of project staff becoming infected. If logistics allow, then adding this one additional day to the quarantine process should be strongly considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Observations of outbreak frequency at the TCP are not high enough to statistically show that the frequency has declined since the implementation of the described quarantine procedure. That said, the patterns strongly suggest beneficial impacts from this procedure. Before the implementation of quarantine, TCP experienced six major outbreaks between 1999 and 2006. Since its implementation, the TCP has only experienced one further outbreak (in 2009), one that started when the quarantine was ignored (Leendertz, unpublished data). This underscores the argument that following quarantine rules is essential. It also demonstrates that all measures taken only result in risk reduction and emergency protocols must be kept in place for any outbreak intervention. Our data and observations clearly suggest that quarantine does not replace monitoring for symptoms—they need to be used synergistically.
     </p>
     <p>
      In conclusion, it is important to note that single measures are insufficient for obtaining ethically acceptable risk reduction. Several hygiene measures need to be combined: the implementation of quarantine and symptom monitoring with keeping a minimum distance of 7 m and wearing surgical masks (especially as chimpanzees do not follow distance rules) (Gilardi et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0012">
       2015
      </xref>
      ; Köndgen et al.,
      <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajp22619-bib-0018">
       2008
      </xref>
      ). Moreover, through monitoring and diagnostic investigation we can further characterize the real risk while assuring that the preventive measures are being followed.

        Much concern has arisen regarding serious epidemics due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The first MERS case of Korea was reported on 20 May 2015, and since then, the MERS outbreak in Korea has resulted in hundreds of confirmed cases and tens of deaths. Deadly infectious diseases such as MERS have significant direct and indirect social impacts, which include disease-induced mortality and economic losses. Also, a delayed response to the outbreak and underestimating its danger can further aggravate the situation. Hence, an analysis and establishing efficient strategies for preventing the propagation of MERS is a very important and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. For the SIQ based ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach.

     <p id="para0004">
      First confirmed on 20 May 2015, the latest outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in Korea accounted for 186 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 36 deaths, 138 recovered individuals discharged from hospitals, and 12 remaining in hospitals up to 28 July 2015, a de facto end date of the outbreak (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0019">
       Ministry of Health and Welfare , MoH
      </xref>
      ). It spread remarkably fast in hospitals, which has caused the largest MERS outbreak outside the Middle East. The case fatality rate of 19.4% is, however, much lower than the reported rate of 37.7% prior to the outbreak in Korea, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The MERS-CoV is a novel betacoronavirus which was first identified from the sputum of a 60-year-old man in fall 2012 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0028">
       Zaki et al., 2012
      </xref>
      ). Clinical features of MERS range from mild illness to fatal conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in patients with underlying comorbidities (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0029">
       Zumla et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). Although it is initially known as a zoonotic disease, human-to-human transmission occurs in health care settings and now is linked with significant morbidity (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0020">
       Oboho et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ). This outbreak of the MERS-CoV infection, including the index cases roommates, their caregiver, and even the healthcare workers, in what is called as a super-spreading event (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0015">
       Kupferschmidt, 2015
      </xref>
      ), raised several important issues for global public health surveillance and raised several issues regarding infection control policies, including the control of nosocomial transmission to avoid a repeated outbreak (

      In this study, we carry out an epidemiological assessment of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea in order to provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the pathogen spread and establishing efficient guidelines for implementing quarantine and isolation strategies. More specifically, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. The proposed SIQ model is innovative, in that the MERS transmission probability is time-dependent, monotone decreasing, and squashing-type. More specifically, it is initially almost flat, then decreasing rapidly, and finally gradually reaching a saturation point, which is reasonable because this can reflect the change in individuals’ hygienic behaviour with time. Recently, there has been much interest in investigating some aspects of the time-dependent nature of the disease transmission probability. In particular, several methods have been considered to model the time-dependence due to the impact of media coverage (

       Cui, Sun, Zhu, 2008

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0025">
       Xiao, Tang, Wu, 2015
      </xref>
      ). However, these studies have mostly focused on only a single factor under consideration. In this paper, we consider all relevant factors that can affect the MERS transmission probability (
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      , media coverage, increased awareness, etc.) collectively, and try to model the resultant time-dependent transmission probability using a sigmoidal function. Note that the sigmoidal functions are quite popular in the field of machine learning when one needs to address monotone and squashing-type phenomena. For the proposed SIQ model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach. Finally in the last two sections of this paper, discussion and concluding remarks are given along with brief descriptions of data treatment.

       In this section, we will propose a nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) model for analyzing the MERS outbreak in Korea. The SIQ model is a generalization of an epidemiological population model involving susceptible, infectious, and quarantined compartments (

       describes the rate of change of the susceptible compartment population, with four terms on its right-hand side. Its first term concerns the transition from

        S

       due to quarantine of susceptible individuals. This term can be explained in terms of a bilinear incidence law having a contact rate

       together with

       , and
       <italic>
        q
       </italic>
       , the probability of quarantine per contact. The second and third terms model the transition from
       <italic>

       to

        C

       to

        S
        <sub>

       , and this transition means the release from quarantine into the wider community. In the second equation of
       <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq0001">
        (1)
       </xref>
       , the rate of change of the infectious compartment population is described by two terms. The first represents the transition from the susceptible state to the infectious state, and the second term denotes the transition from

       to

        C
        <sub>
         q
        </sub>
       </italic>
       due to detection and isolation of the infectious patients. The remaining equations of
       <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq0001">
        (1)
       </xref>
       describe the rates of change of
       <italic>
        S
        <sub>
         q

        C
        <sub>

       in the super-compartment
       <italic>
        Q
       </italic>
       , respectively, and the exact meaning of their terms can be explained similarly. The natural birth and death rates are not considered in the SIQ model, and this omission allows us to focus on the core theme of the paper. Note that consideration of these additional aspects is relatively straightforward, and would lead us to some further related observations. For example, if the natural birth rate of a susceptible population, Λ, and the natural death rate,
       <italic>
        d
       </italic>
       , are considered, the resultant reduced SIQ system

       We performed simulations based on the estimated parameters. Simulation results (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0004">
        Fig. 4
       </xref>
       ) show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">
        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       ) for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well. Our parameter estimation results show that the MERS transmission probability,
       <italic>
        β
       </italic>
       (
       <italic>
        t
       </italic>
       ), is initially almost flat, then decreasing rapidly, and finally gradually reaching a saturation point (see the solid line of
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       ). This has a natural interpretation, in that as information on the MERS outbreak becomes more widely known with the passage of time, health authorities’ and individuals’ efforts against the epidemic intensify accordingly, which results in the MERS transmission probability decreasing in the squashing-type fashion, as in
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       . In retrospect, if the initial effort to reduce the MERS transmission probability were more effective, the magnitude of
       <italic>
        β
       </italic>
       <sub>

       </sub>
       could be decreased further. In order to investigate this aspect, we additionally performed simulations for a scenario with
       <italic>
        β
       </italic>
       <sub>

       reduced to 90% of its estimated value (see the dashed line of
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       ).
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0006">
        Fig. 6
       </xref>
       shows that the infectious population could be reduced significantly if the aforementioned effort were successful. In order to clarify why it is important to consider the incidence rate of the type shown in
       <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq0002">
        (2)
       </xref>
       , we also considered the constant beta case, and provided the corresponding simulation results (

       ). Comparing

       From the data fitting based on the SIQ model, we have already obtained the estimation results for the quarantine probability,

       , and the isolation rate,
       <italic>
        θ
       </italic>
       . In retrospect, however, control-theoretic investigation is desirable for the purpose of improving our response to the outbreak. In the following, we consider the problem of improving the quarantine probability and isolation rate further with additional efforts (

      In recent years, global pandemic viral infections, including the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome, the 2009 H1N1 influenza, and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, have been devastating but provided valuable experience in outbreak responses. For public health control, increased vigilance by health professionals and voluntary compliance by the public are essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions. In this study, we carried out an epidemiological assessment of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea in order to provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the pathogen spread and establishing efficient guidelines for implementing quarantine and isolation strategies. The following have been observed by the assessment:

         Our nonlinear epidemiological models showed that the MERS transmission probability decreased in the squashing-type fashion and then approached a saturation point in a time-dependent manner. As information on the MERS outbreak became widely known in the nation, efforts against this epidemic, including individuals hygienic behavior, and interventions by health care facilities and by authorities were accordingly strengthened. In our SIQ-based analysis, the inflection point for transmission probability was found to be

         corresponding to a couple of days after 7 June 2015. Interestingly, 7 June 2015 was the day when the Korean government revealed the names of 24 MERS-affected hospitals to the public. After releasing the names of affected medical facilities, the rate of increase in new confirmed cases abated. As a practical guideline to avoid another similar unexpected outbreak, we draw the conclusion that combined efforts in the early stage are critically important, and sharing information including the names of affected hospitals or countries, clinical situations, and prevention methods might be important for global public health control.

      In conclusion, this paper proposes a nonlinear epidemiological ODE for the MERS outbreak in Korea, the SIQ model, in which the state variables are defined as the populations of four compartments (

We performed the task of parameter estimation for the SIQ model, and the data fitting results explained the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well. We also applied optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Our simulation results show that MERS propagation was controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach. In future work, we will conduct further simulation studies, with the aim of revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method, and investigate stability and control issues for its various extensions, including a stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach.

       ) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health and Welfare in the Republic of Korea. The data included information on the cumulative number of reported cases. The first MERS case in Korea was confirmed on 20 May 2015, and the numbers of newly confirmed cases and suspected patients who had been quarantined to prevent possible spread of the MERS have reached 186 cases and 16,693 cases, respectively, as of 28 July 2015. The data also included a brief description of each confirmed case with exposure date and onset of symptoms, and they were sufficient to estimate our SIQ model for the MERS outbreak epidemiology. In this model, we assumed MERS is unlikely to spread to another region.

       <p>
        Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.

     CoVs are capable of rapid mutation and recombination leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. This occurred in China in 2002 when the novel CoV severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged, thought to have been transmitted from civet cats or bats to humans.

     The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, where The Health Commission of Hubei province first announced a cluster of adults with pneumonia of unexplained etiology on December 31, 2019. A local seafood and animal market was identified as a potential source. However, the main driver of the outbreak is symptomatic and asymptomatic humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 from whom the virus can spread to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact.

       These large numbers of secondary infections have been mostly associated with nosocomial outbreaks: 30% of all SARS-CoV cases (mostly health care workers) and 44%–100% of all MERS-CoV cases (mostly patients) occurred from nosocomial transmissions.

       Therefore, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have low potential for long-term sustained community transmission. No human SARS-CoV infections have been detected since July 2003. However, SARS-CoV-like viruses can be found in bats, which are known to be able infect human cells without adaptation, making it possible for SARS-CoVs to reemerge

       Live-attenuated Vaccines
      </title>
      <p>
       The advantage of live-attenuated vaccines is that they usually induce a robust and long-lasting immune response, including cellular and humoral immunity to many different antigens. In SARS-CoV animal studies, attenuated mutants with deletion of the structural E gene have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies, reduce viral loads and protect from clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV infection.

      OTHER STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING EMERGING CORONAVIRUSES
     </title>
     <p>
      After quickly spreading across the globe, SARS-CoV was contained in 2003 after a highly effective global public health response. This highlights the urgent need for rapid and effectful strategies of infection control. One of the main challenges with novel CoVs is the high potential for nosocomial transmission.
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R239">
        239
       </xref>
      </sup>
      Health care settings seem to increase the risk of viral transmission due to aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and bronchoscopy. Appropriate hospital hygiene practices are therefore crucial to limit nosocomial outbreaks. The main aims are to effectively triage patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and a contact history
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R240">
        240

      and to apply stringent infection control measures such as isolating patients and quarantine contacts as early as possible. Ideally, each patient is placed in a single negative pressure room. If this is not possible, patients and health care workers should be cohorted.

      SUMMARY
     </title>
     <p>
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections seem to affect children less commonly and less severely as compared with adults. This might be because children are less frequently exposed to the main sources of transmission (which until now has been disproportionally nosocomial) or because they are less exposed to animals. However, it could also be that children are less frequently symptomatic or have less severe symptoms and are therefore less often tested, leading to an underestimate of the true numbers infected. In relation to SARS-CoV-2, a study prepublished in early March 2020 suggests that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with this virus but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.
      <sup>
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R246">
        246
       </xref>
      </sup>
      However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. The majority of children infected by a novel CoVs reported thus far have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them, suggesting the possibility that children are not an important reservoir for novel CoVs. The clinical, laboratory and radiologic features in children are similar for all novel CoVs, except more children infected with SARS-CoV presented with fever compared with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. To date, no deaths in children have been reported for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, except (in the case of the former) for infants of mothers who were infected during pregnancy.

       <p>
        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), continues to cause severe respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. To date, potential antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV have shown limited efficacy in animal studies. Here, we tested the efficacy of the broad-acting antiviral remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection. Remdesivir reduced the severity of disease, virus replication, and damage to the lungs when administered either before or after animals were infected with MERS-CoV. Our data show that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment against MERS that could be considered for implementation in clinical trials. It may also have utility for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.

        The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

     Since its discovery in 2012, cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have continued to emerge, with the current case count close to 2,500 cases, and a case fatality rate ∼35% (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">
      1
     </xref>
     ). This continuous emergence of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia and its ability to spread through human-to-human transmission has prompted the World Health Organization to include MERS on their list of emerging diseases likely to cause major epidemics and for which countermeasures are urgently needed (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">
      2
     </xref>
     ). Through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, MERS-CoV vaccines are going to advance through preclinical and clinical trials (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">
      3
     </xref>
     ), but, despite the urgent need, a similar initiative does not exist for the development and clinical testing of antivirals effective against MERS-CoV.

     Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide prodrug that has broad antiviral activity against viruses from different families in vitro (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">

     ), and therapeutic efficacy in nonhuman primate models of lethal Ebola virus and Nipah virus infection (

     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">
      6
     </xref>
     ). Studies in human airway epithelial cells showed that remdesivir also inhibits replication of a wide range of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">
      7
     </xref>
     ). Efficacy studies in mice showed that remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV in Ces1c
     <sup>
      −/−
     </sup>
     mice, deficient in a secreted carboxylesterase responsible for poor pharmacokinetics profile of remdesivir in mice, when administered before the peak of virus replication (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">
      7
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">
      8
     </xref>
     ). In vitro studies with mouse hepatitis virus showed that remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication through interference with the viral polymerase, despite the presence of a viral proofreading exoribonuclease (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">
      9
     </xref>
     ). Importantly, coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir, obtained in vitro following &gt;20 passages in the presence of GS-441524, a parent nucleoside that is metabolized into the same active triphosphate metabolite, were still sensitive to higher concentrations of remdesivir, and fitness was impaired in the resistant viruses as compared to wild-type MERS-CoV (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">
      9
     </xref>
     ). With these promising data in mind, we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque (

       To assess the efficacy of remdesivir to alleviate clinical signs of MERS-CoV infection, 18 rhesus macaques were randomly assigned to three groups of six animals. Three animals in the control group were treated with 1 mL/kg vehicle solution 24 h before MERS-CoV inoculation, and three animals were treated at 12 h post MERS-CoV inoculation. Another group of six rhesus macaques was treated prophylactically 24 h before MERS-CoV inoculation with 5 mg/kg remdesivir, and one group of six animals was treated therapeutically at 12 h postinoculation with MERS-CoV with 5 mg/kg remdesivir. Treatment was continued once daily until 6 d postinoculation (dpi), when animals were euthanized and necropsied (

         Study outline. To test the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, three groups of six rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012; one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 24 h before inoculation (black circles), and one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 12 h after inoculation (red circles). One group of six control animals was i.v.-administered 1 mL/kg vehicle solution, with three animals receiving vehicle solution according to the prophylactic treatment schedule, and three animals receiving it according to the therapeutic treatment schedule. Treatment was continued once daily until 6 dpi, when all animals were euthanized. At 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 dpi, clinical examinations were performed to monitor the health status of the animals.

       After inoculation with MERS-CoV on day 0, all animals were closely observed for signs of disease, and clinical scores were assigned according to a previously determined scoring sheet. All vehicle-treated animals displayed signs of disease, starting as early as 1 dpi, such as decreased appetite and ruffled fur; all vehicle-treated animals had respiratory signs such as increased respiration for 4 (

The animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir did not show any respiratory signs of disease, but decreased appetite, possibly due to daily anesthesia, was noted in five of six animals. The animals treated therapeutically with remdesivir all displayed reduced appetites, and five out of six animals had increased respiration rates at 2 (

Three groups of six rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012; one group was i.v.-administered 1 mL/kg vehicle solution (vehicle control; gray circles), one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 24 h before inoculation (prophylactic remdesivir; black squares), and one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 12 h after inoculation (therapeutic remdesivir; red triangles).

       In addition, the severity of histologic lung lesions was assessed by assigning a score for each lung lobe. The resulting cumulative lung histology score was compared between treatment groups to assess differences in the severity of histologic lesions. Cumulative lung histology scores were significantly lower in animals treated prophylactically with remdesivir (

       Histologically, all of the vehicle-treated control animals developed some degree of pulmonary pathology when inoculated with MERS-CoV. Lesions were multifocal, frequently centered on terminal bronchioles, and consisted of minimal to marked, interstitial pneumonia, characterized by thickening of alveolar septae by edema fluid and fibrin and small to moderate numbers of macrophages and fewer neutrophils. Alveoli contained moderate numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils. In areas with moderate to marked changes, there was abundant alveolar edema and fibrin with multifocal formation of hyaline membranes, as well as abundant type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Perivascular infiltrates of inflammatory cells multifocally within and adjacent to affected areas of the lung were also observed (

In two out of six animals, no histologic evidence of pneumonia was detected. In three animals, multifocal, minimal to moderate interstitial pneumonia was observed like that described for the control animals; however, the lesions were less severe than in the controls and not as widely distributed throughout the lung lobes. Only one out of six animals had moderate interstitial pneumonia that was indistinguishable from the vehicle-treated control animals in severity and distribution.

      Prophylactic remdesivir treatment prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease and lung lesions in rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV, and strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues. Since nosocomial transmission accounts for approximately one-third of MERS-CoV cases (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">
       11
      </xref>
      ), prophylactic remdesivir treatment of patients, contacts of patients, and healthcare personnel with high-risk exposure to a diagnosed MERS patient and at high risk of developing severe MERS due to underlying conditions (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">
       12
      </xref>
      ) could be considered. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs and virus replication, and the absence of lung lesions in two out of six remdesivir-treated animals and a reduction in lesion severity in three additional animals. Absence of histologic lung lesions, as seen in two out of the six animals with therapeutic remdesivir treatment, has so far rarely been observed in studies testing the efficacy of MERS-CoV antivirals in nonhuman primate models (

      –
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">

      ); it has only been shown once before in one out of three common marmosets treated with hyperimmune plasma at 6 h after inoculation (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">
       17
      </xref>
      ). Thus, although it is hard to compare different studies due to the fact that different species were used and treatment was initiated at different time points after inoculation, remdesivir appears to be one of the most promising antiviral treatments tested in a nonhuman primate model to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therapeutic remdesivir treatment was administered at 12 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV, and, although this may seem relatively early after inoculation, it is close to the peak of MERS-CoV replication in the rhesus macaque model (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">
       10
      </xref>
      ). A drug that inhibits virus replication may be of little use once virus replication has reached its peak, as was shown in vitro (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">
       9
      </xref>
      ). However, in a considerable number of severe cases of MERS, viral RNA and infectious virus can still be detected in respiratory tract samples several weeks after the onset of symptoms (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">
       18
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">
       19
      </xref>
      ), with this prolonged virus replication most likely due to the presence of underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">
       18
      </xref>
      ). Likewise, an increase in virus replication over a longer period of time was observed in immunocompromised rhesus macaques (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">
       20

      ). Thus, remdesivir treatment could not only be of benefit to patients diagnosed with MERS early after symptom onset but may also improve recovery in those patients with severe cases of MERS where prolonged virus replication occurs.

      Human safety data are available for remdesivir. It has been used on a compassionate basis in several unique cases of Ebola virus disease (

      ,

      ), as well as on a large scale in the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">
       23
      </xref>
      ), with around 400 treated patients. In addition, its efficacy is currently being tested in a clinical trial in Ebola virus disease survivors with prolonged virus shedding (

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">

      ). Although the efficacy of remdesivir was lower in the Ebola virus trial than that of the different antibody treatments tested, survival was increased as compared to overall survival rate in this outbreak.

       Ethics and Biosafety Statement.

      <p>
       All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out by certified staff in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility, according to the institution’s guidelines for animal use, and followed the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light−dark cycle (12-h light/12-h dark). Animals were monitored at least twice daily throughout the experiment. Commercial monkey chow, treats, and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel. Water was available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction, commercial toys, videos, and music. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with infectious MERS-CoV strains under BSL3 conditions. Sample inactivation was performed according to IBC-approved standard operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment.

       Study Design.

      <p>
       To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on MERS-CoV disease outcome, we used the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">
        10
       </xref>
       ). Rhesus macaques were chosen because of the requirement of daily anesthesia and intravenous (i.v.) injections that were perceived to be problematic in the alternative nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the common marmoset (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">
        27
       </xref>
       ), due to their small size. All animals were randomly assigned to groups and inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 7 × 10

       ). In the first experiment, the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir treatment was tested in one group of six rhesus macaques (all males; female rhesus macaques were not available from the supplier at the time of this study) treated with 5 mg/kg remdesivir in vehicle solution (5 mg/mL 12% sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid, pH3.5) and three control rhesus macaques (all males) who received the same volume (1 mL/kg) of vehicle solution. This 5 mg/kg dosing in rhesus macaques is roughly equivalent to the 100-mg daily dosing used in humans in the Ebola virus clinical trials. Treatment was initiated at 24 h before virus inoculation and continued once daily until 6 dpi. After observing good efficacy of remdesivir upon prophylactic treatment, a second experiment was performed to assess its therapeutic efficacy. One group of six rhesus macaques (all males) was treated with 5 mg/kg remdesivir, and three control rhesus macaques (all males) received the same volume of vehicle solution. Due to the acute nature of the MERS-CoV model in rhesus macaques, therapeutic treatment was initiated at 12 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV and continued once daily until 6 dpi. Treatment was delivered as a slow i.v. bolus injection (total dose delivered over ∼5 min) administered alternatingly in the left or right cephalic and saphenous veins. The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease, using a standardized scoring sheet as described previously (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">
        28
       </xref>
       ); the same person, who was blinded to the group assignment of the animals, assessed the animals throughout the study. The predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 6 dpi. Clinical examinations were performed at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 dpi on anesthetized animals. On examination days, clinical parameters such as body weight and respiration rate were collected, as well as dorsal−ventral and lateral chest radiographs. Chest radiographs were analyzed by a board-certified clinical veterinarian blinded to the group assignment of the animals. After euthanasia at 6 dpi, necropsies were performed. The percentage of gross lung lesions were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals, and samples of the following tissues were collected: conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, mandibular lymph node, tonsil, pharynx, trachea, all six lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney, and bladder. Histopathological analysis of tissue slides was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals.

       Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed on rhesus macaque tissues. After fixation for 7 d in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). To detect HCoV-EMC/2012 antigen, immunohistochemistry was performed using an in-house rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1:1,000) as a primary antibody. Stained slides were analyzed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals.

        ABSTRACT
       </title>
       <p>
        Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs
        <italic>
         in vitro
        </italic>
        and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC
        <sub>
         50
        </sub>
        ) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC
        <sub>
         50
        </sub>
        . The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same
        <italic>
         in vitro
        </italic>
        resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.

        IMPORTANCE
       </title>
       <p>
        Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group β-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV
        <italic>
         in vitro
        </italic>
        and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.

      INTRODUCTION

     <p>
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animal hosts. In humans, CoVs were recognized as typically causing colds and pneumonia until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 from zoonotic sources (

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

      ). Although the SARS epidemic was controlled by public health measures within a year of its emergence, the virus spread to over 30 countries and was associated with a 10% mortality rate (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
       23
      </xref>
      ). However, the study was not designed to define, nor did it report, potential pathways and implications of resistance for virus fitness and virulence. Further, studies demonstrating the efficacy of GS-5734 against CoVs and other viruses, including Ebolavirus, have not described resistance mutations. Using the model β-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), we here demonstrate that GS-5734 dramatically inhibits viral replication and viral RNA synthesis in wild-type (WT) virus, while an nsp14 ExoN(−) mutant lacking proofreading demonstrates increased susceptibility to GS-5734. Passage of WT MHV with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside GS-441524 resulted in phenotypic resistance associated with two nonsynonymous mutations in the predicted fingers domain of the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (F476L and V553L). The engineered mutations in the MHV cloned background closely recapitulated the partial resistance phenotype and restored RNA levels in the presence of GS-5734. However, resistant viruses could not compete with WT MHV during

       GS-5734 acts at early times postinfection to decrease viral RNA levels.

       The predicted mechanism of action of GS-5734 is through incorporation of the active triphosphate into viral RNA (

       </xref>
       ). We therefore tested the hypothesis that GS-5734 would inhibit CoVs at early steps in replication by inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. To determine which stage in the viral replication cycle GS-5734 inhibited CoVs, we infected cells with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell, which with MHV results in a single-cycle infection, and treated them with 2 μM GS-5734 at 2-h intervals from 2 h preinfection to 10 h postinfection. We observed maximal inhibition when GS-5734 was added between 2 h preinfection and 2 h postinfection. Less inhibition was detected when GS-5734 was added between 4 and 6 h postinfection, and no inhibition was observed when GS-5734 was added after 8 h postinfection (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">

       Viruses lacking ExoN-mediated proofreading are more sensitive to treatment with GS-5734.
      </title>
      <p>
       We have shown that the profound resistance of CoVs to the nucleoside and base analogues RBV and 5-FU is due to the proofreading ExoN in nsp14, as engineered ExoN(−) mutant MHV and SARS-CoV are profoundly more sensitive to these compounds (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
        22
       </xref>
       ). We therefore compared the sensitivity of WT and ExoN(−) MHV to GS-5734. ExoN(−) MHV demonstrated up to a 100-fold greater reduction in viral titer at 0.25 μM GS-5734 compared to WT virus (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">

       ). This increased sensitivity of ExoN(−) virus to GS-5734 is similar to that of other nucleoside analogues and suggests that GS-5734 is incorporated into viral RNA and can be removed by ExoN. However, the results also suggest there is a fundamentally different relationship of GS-5734 with the CoV replicase and/or template RNA compared with other nucleosides such as ribavirin or 5-fluorouracil, since GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading (

       Two mutations in the RdRp mediate partial resistance and restoration of RNA levels in the presence of GS-5734.
      </title>
      <p>
       We next sought to identify the target(s) of GS-5734 inhibition. Three lineages of WT MHV were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524. GS-441524 was chosen for passage selection because GS-5734 and GS-441524 are both metabolized to the same active triphosphate metabolite (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">
        27
       </xref>
       ), but GS-441524 provided a larger working range of concentrations. Two lineages did not demonstrate an increase in viral cytopathic effect (CPE) over passage and were lost after passages 17 (p17) and p20. After 23 passages, we observed an increased ability of one passage lineage to replicate in the presence of GS-441524 as determined by increased viral CPE. Full-genome sequencing of p23 viral RNA revealed 6 nonsynonymous mutations in four viral protein-coding regions (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">
        Fig. 5A
       </xref>
       ): the nsp13 helicase (A335V), the ns2 2′,5′ phosphodiesterase (Q67H), the spike glycoprotein (A34V and I924T), and the nsp12 RdRp (F476L and V553L) (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">
        Fig. 5B

       ). Molecular modeling of the MHV RdRp predicts that both the F476 and V553 residues reside within the predicted fingers domain of the conserved right-hand structure of the RdRp (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">
        27
       </xref>
       ), we first engineered and recovered recombinant MHV containing the F476L and V553L RdRp mutations to determine if they were necessary and sufficient for the observed resistance phenotype of the p23 virus population. Recombinant MHV containing either F476L or V553L individually was less sensitive to GS-5734 than WT MHV, but still more sensitive than the p23 virus population across a broad range of concentrations. In contrast, MHV encoding both F476L and V553L demonstrated a resistance pattern comparable to p23 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">
        Fig. 6A
       </xref>
       ). Neither the p23 virus population nor any of the recombinant viruses were completely resistant to GS-5734; all viruses remained sensitive to higher but nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734. Compared to WT MHV, the F476L virus showed 2.4-fold resistance to GS-5734, and V553L virus demonstrated 5-fold resistance to GS-5734, while combined mutations mediated 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734 based on EC

       values (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">
        Table 2
       </xref>
       ). Because GS-5734 decreases viral RNA levels, we next tested if resistance mutations restored RNA synthesis. We observed that RdRp resistance mutations partially restored RNA levels in the presence of GS-5734 and that the degree of restoration of RNA levels correlated with their fold resistance to GS-5734 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">

       GS-5734 resistance mutations impair competitive fitness of MHV.

       To assess the effect of GS-5734 resistance on viral fitness, we first determined the replication capacity of recombinant MHV carrying the F476L, V553L, and F476L + V553L mutations. Each of these viruses replicated similarly to WT MHV, both in replication kinetics and in observed peak titer (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">
        Fig. 6C
       </xref>
       ). We next tested the competitive fitness of F476L + V553L MHV compared to WT MHV during coinfection over multiple passages. Murine DBT cells were coinfected with WT MHV and F476L + V553L MHV at WT/mutant ratios of 1:1, 1:9, or 9:1 in the absence of GS-5734, and infected culture supernatants were serially passaged 3 times to fresh cell monolayers. By passage 2, F476L + V553L MHV was outcompeted by WT MHV in the population at every input ratio (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">
        Fig. 6D

       ), demonstrating a competitive fitness cost of the F476L + V553L mutations in the absence of GS-5734. This competitive fitness cost further suggests that GS-5734 resistance mutations will not persist in the absence of treatment.

       Given the complete conservation of the F476 and V553 residues across CoVs, we next tested whether substitutions at the homologous SARS-CoV residues (F480L and V557L) could confer resistance to GS-5734. We recovered SARS-CoV carrying the homologous F480L and V557L substitutions and tested recovered mutant viruses for resistance to GS-5734 in Calu-3 2B4 cells. WT SARS-CoV demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition by GS-5734, with an EC

      DISCUSSION
     </title>
     <p>
      Broadly active antivirals are needed to treat contemporary human CoV infections, including endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East and potential future zoonotic CoV epidemics. We recently demonstrated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of GS-5734 (remdesivir) in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, as well as

      activity against multiple other human and zoonotic CoVs (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
       23
      </xref>
      ). In this study, we have defined the ability of GS-5734 to inhibit CoVs—expanded to include group 2a β-CoVs—in the setting of intact nsp14 proofreading activities. While ExoN(−) MHV is 4.5-fold more sensitive to GS-5734 treatment than WT MHV, the potent inhibition of WT CoVs suggests a unique mechanism of inhibition of CoV RNA synthesis that is able to circumvent ExoN surveillance and activity. Further, we report for the first time for any virus inhibited by GS-5734 that selection for partial resistance to GS-5734 required prolonged passage. Surprisingly, no resistance mutations were selected within ExoN, but rather two mutations of highly conserved residues in the RdRp reduced the sensitivity to GS-5734 to a level comparable to that of the passaged virus. Introduction of the homologous substitutions in SARS-CoV reproduced the fold resistance to GS-5734 observed in MHV, demonstrating the potential for common, family-wide drug resistance pathways in the RdRp.

       Potential GS-5734 mechanism of action.

      <p>
       Nucleoside analogues can have multiple mechanisms of action, including lethal mutagenesis, obligate or nonobligate chain termination, and perturbation of natural nucleotide triphosphate pools via inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis (

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">

       ). GS-5734 has been reported to cause premature termination of nascent RNA transcripts by the purified RSV polymerase, but the mechanism of inhibition of other viral polymerases has not been fully explored (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">
        27
       </xref>
       ). Our data demonstrate that GS-5734 acts early in infection and decreases RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner that parallels impairment of viral titer. Further, while GS-5734 is highly active against WT CoVs, it is 4.5-fold more active in MHV lacking the proofreading activity of ExoN. Finally, GS-5734 is 3 to 30 times more active than GS-441524 in all of the CoVs we have tested (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
        23
       </xref>
       ). The result is consistent with the report that GS-5734 is metabolized more efficiently than GS-441524 into the triphosphate metabolite (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">
        27
       </xref>
       ). All of the above findings support a mechanism involving incorporation of GS-5734 into nascent CoV RNA, but do not discriminate between chain termination and incorporation mutagenesis. In fact, other nucleoside analogues have multiple proposed mechanisms of virus inhibition, including favipiravir in influenza virus and RBV in HCV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">

       ). Future studies using deep sequencing and biochemical approaches will allow us to precisely define the GS-5734 mechanism(s) of action against CoVs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nucleoside analogues have been approved to treat a variety of RNA and DNA viruses, but CoVs have been refractory to inhibition by some nucleoside analogues (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
        22
       </xref>
       ). This resistance to potent inhibition by RBV and 5-FU has been attributed to the CoV nsp14 proofreading exoribonuclease. We have previously reported that MHV and SARS-CoV strains lacking the proofreading activity of ExoN [ExoN(−)] were more sensitive to 5-FU and RBV, underscoring the role of ExoN-mediated proofreading in resistance to inhibition by these compounds (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
        22
       </xref>
       ). These results suggest that to effectively inhibit CoVs, nucleoside analogues would need to inhibit ExoN directly, be incorporated so efficiently that the 5′-3′ elongation reaction is much faster than the ExoN cleavage reaction, or not be recognized for ExoN-mediated removal. The latter mechanism has been proposed for sensitivity of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to acyclovir; specifically, that the HSV exonuclease is unable to remove acyclovir (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">
        45
       </xref>
       ). Here, we show that ExoN(−) MHV is more sensitive than WT MHV to GS-5734 treatment. This result suggests that GS-5734 is recognized, at least partially, by a functional ExoN, but that the ExoN activity is not sufficient to prevent potent inhibition of CoV replication. One possible explanation is that GS-5734 may be recognized and removed by ExoN less efficiently than these mutagens or other incorrect nucleotides, though further studies are needed to fully understand the role of ExoN in GS-5734 inhibition of CoVs. Overall, the enhanced activity of the monophosphate prodrug, the increased sensitivity of ExoN(−) viruses to GS-5734 inhibition, selected resistance mutations in the modeled RdRp finger domain, the time-dependent viral inhibition profile, and decreased viral RNA levels support the hypothesis that GS-5734 directly inhibits viral RNA synthesis.

       Mechanism of resistance to GS-5734.
      </title>
      <p>
       Previous studies have assessed inhibition by GS-5734 in multiple viruses, but none have reported resistance mutations during treatment. In this study, passage of MHV in the presence of GS-441524 resulted in selection of 5.6-fold resistance. Sequencing identified consensus nonsynonymous F476L and V553L mutations in the nsp12 core polymerase-coding region. A similar level of resistance was observed for the homologous F480L and V557L substitutions in SARS-CoV. As these mutations are not in the immediate vicinity of the RdRp active site, the mechanism of resistance to GS-5734 remains to be determined. Both of these residues are conserved across CoVs, suggesting that they mediate conserved functions. Sequence alignment and molecular modeling of the CoV RdRp predicts that V553L lies within motif F of the fingers domain, which forms a channel for incoming NTPs and contacts the 5′end of the template, while F476L is not within any defined structural motif but also resides in the fingers domain (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">
        46
       </xref>
       ). Resistance mutations to nucleoside analogues, including those that lie in the fingers domain, have been implicated in altering replication fidelity as a mechanism of resistance in picornaviruses and HIV (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">
        34

       ,

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">
        48
       </xref>
       ). In a previous study, using homology modeling of the CoV RdRp based on the coxsackievirus B3 RdRp structure, we predicted and confirmed that a V553I substitution in the MHV RdRp increases CoV fidelity in ExoN(−) viruses (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">
        32
       </xref>
       ), suggesting that viral replication fidelity modulation may also impact susceptibility to GS-5734. This is supported by the result that GS-5734, while highly active in WT virus, is even more potent in the absence of nsp14 ExoN proofreading activity. However, the CoV replicase encodes many proteins, and these mutations may alter protein-protein interactions among these components. The availability of an
       <italic>
        in vitro
       </italic>
       biochemical system demonstrating both polymerase and exoribonuclease activities suggests it may be possible to define specific effects of GS-5734 resistance mutations on polymerase and RNA proofreading activities (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">
        49

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">

       </xref>
       ). Thus, it will be interesting to determine if F476L and V553L confer class-level resistance to nucleotide analogues, general increased fidelity, changes in specific nucleotide selectivity, alterations in replicase-protein interactions, or other novel mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recombinant MHV containing the F476L and V553L mutations very closely recapitulated the GS-5734 resistance phenotype of passage 23 virus population, confirming the importance of these mutations for resistance. However, these results do not eliminate the possibility that other potential pathways to GS-5734 resistance may exist. Additionally, we also identified additional non-RdRp mutations in the consensus sequence of passage 23 virus, including another component of the MHV replicase, the nsp13 helicase. It will be important to determine if other proteins contribute to resistance, as well as using GS-5734 as a probe to define protein interactions and functions within the viral replicase.

       provides an opportunity to assess the concern that resistance may promote viral fitness, leading to enhanced transmission or greater disease severity. The resistance of MHV to GS-5734 was very slow to emerge and only partial, suggesting a high genetic barrier to resistance, similar to that seen for HCV resistance to the nucleotide antiviral sofosbuvir (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">
        51
       </xref>
       ). Moreover, although recombinant MHV containing both F476L and V553L replicated similarly to WT in parallel cultures, resistant virus failed to compete with WT MHV during coinfection over multiple passages, demonstrating a fitness cost associated with the resistance mutations that may limit emergence during treatment. The fitness impairment was further evidenced
       <italic>
        in vivo
       </italic>
       by attenuation of F480L + V557L virus in a SARS-CoV mouse model, similar to that reported for other viruses with selected resistance to nucleotide analogues, including HIV and chikungunya virus (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">

       </xref>
       ). This fitness impairment may be due to alterations in RNA replication, fidelity, nucleotide incorporation, or protein stability but suggests that GS-5734 resistance will not lead to more transmissible or pathogenic virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, our work provides evidence that GS-5734 is highly active against CoVs and that there is a high genetic barrier to achieve resistance. Additionally, resistant virus suffers a loss of competitive fitness
       <italic>
        in vitro
       </italic>
       and attenuation in animals, suggesting these mutations will not favor disease emergence and are likely to be poorly maintained in nature, particularly during acute infections. Finally, the results identify potential novel determinants of polymerase function and nucleotide selectivity or fidelity that will guide future structure-function and biochemical studies of the polymerase and GS-5734 mechanism. Together, these results argue strongly for the continued clinical development of GS-5734 to treat MERS-CoV and demonstrate its potential utility in the broad-spectrum treatment of CoV infections.

Supernatant was collected, and total RNA was harvested using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) after 10 or 20 h, respectively. The viral titer was determined by plaque assay, and RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA that was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as previously described (

       WT MHV was passaged in triplicate in increasing concentrations of GS-441524, ranging from 1 to 12 μM. Infection was initiated for passage 1 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. Supernatant was harvested and frozen when the cell monolayer demonstrated 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) or after 24 h. A constant volume of 16 μl was used to initiate subsequent passages. All lineages were maintained until passage 17 (p17). Lineages 2 and 3 were lost after p17 and p20, respectively, when virus CPE did not reach above 50% upon multiple efforts and at various concentrations of GS-441524. Lineage 1 demonstrated an increase in visible CPE, and thus lineage 1 was carried to passage 23. After each passage, total RNA was harvested from infected cell monolayers using the TRIzol reagent to be used for viral population sequencing. After passage 23, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III, followed by generation of amplicons for all three lineages covering nsp12 and nsp14 at passage 16 and 12 PCR amplicons to cover the whole genome after 23 passages of lineage 1. Dideoxy amplicon sequencing was performed by GenHunter (Nashville, TN) and analyzed to identify mutations using MacVector.

       -transcribed genomic RNA. All fragments containing mutations as well as virus stocks were sequenced to ensure mutations were present before use in further studies (GenHunter). To generate SARS-CoV encoding nsp12 resistance substitutions, a 1,450-bp cassette encoding the substitutions (F480L and V557L) was synthesized by BioBasic, Inc. The synthesized cassette was then cloned into the SARS-CoV D infectious cDNA plasmid at unique MluI and MstI sites, and the subsequent selected clone was sequence verified across the cassette. SARS-CoV expressing the resistance substitutions along with the NanoLuc reporter in place of ORF7 was produced as described previously (

       Subconfluent DBT cells were coinfected with F476L + V553L and WT MHV at input ratios of 1:9, 1:1, or 9:1 at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37°C. The virus inoculum was removed, and fresh medium was added. At 20 h postinfection, virus supernatants were collected, and infected cell monolayers were harvested using the TRIzol reagent. Samples were frozen, and cell supernatant was passaged onto fresh DBT cells for a total of four passages. Supernatants and cell monolayers in TRIzol were collected from each passage when nearly all of the monolayer was involved in CPE—approximately 16 h postinfection. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III, and PCR amplicons covering the region of the mutations were sequenced (GenHunter). Results represent the combined frequency of F476L and V553L mutations as determined by chromatographic traces and analyzed using MacVector.

Animals were weighed daily to monitor virus-associated weight loss. On days 2 and 4 postinfection, 5 to 6 animals per group were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose and the inferior right lobe was harvested and frozen at −80°C until the titer was determined by plaque assay as described previously (

        Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the causative agent of a severe respiratory disease associated with more than 2468 human infections and over 851 deaths in 27 countries since 2012. There are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV infection although a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFNb) is currently being evaluated in humans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Here, we show that remdesivir (RDV) and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV in vitro. In mice, both prophylactic and therapeutic RDV improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb slightly reduces viral loads without impacting other disease parameters. Therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections.

      The coronavirus (CoV) family has a propensity for emergence into new hosts often causing novel severe disease. In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was discovered as the causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), has since caused at least 2468 cases and 851 deaths globally

      . MERS-CoV continues to cause human infections globally and thus is listed as a priority pathogen with pandemic potential by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Presently, there are no approved treatments for MERS-CoV or any other human CoV.

      Emerging viral diseases typically have very few if any effective treatment options. As such, treatments designed and approved for other diseases are administered to patients with emerging viral syndromes empirically based on limited clinical or laboratory data. Multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies have been evaluated for antiviral activity against MERS-CoV in vitro including lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir (RTV), and interferon beta (IFNb). LPV is a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor that is usually combined with RTV to increase LPV half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome P450

      . In contrast, studies evaluating the antiviral activity of type I and type II interferons have reported IFNb as the most potent interferon (EC

       We utilized a recombinant MERS-CoV engineered to express a reporter nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC) for our in vitro antiviral activity assays. To ensure that our reporter virus behaved similarly to WT MERS-CoV, we first demonstrated that MERS-nLUC and wild-type (WT) MERS-CoV EMC 2012 strain replicate to similar levels in the absence of drug treatment and are similarly susceptible to the antiviral activity of RDV (WT EC

       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">
        3b

       ), the alveolar air spaces are free of debris and inflammatory cells, the walls (i.e., septae) of the alveolar sac are thin which facilitates efficient gas exchange and rare neutrophils in circulation are seen in the capillaries within alveolar septae, but not in the air spaces. In contrast, vehicle-treated MERS-CoV-infected animals in both viral dosage groups (Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">
        3c
       </xref>
       ) had multiple histologic features of ALI including notable immune cell infiltration into the alveolar septae and resultant septal wall thickening, scattered degenerating and dying cells, proteinaceous debris in the air spaces resulting from capillary leakage some of which is organized into hyaline membranes and neutrophils in alveolar septae as well as in the air spaces. Interestingly, the early hyaline membranes (i.e., thin pink material lining alveoli) were noted in vehicle-treated animals infected with the lower dose of MERS-CoV (Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">
        3c

       Prophylactic studies provide a best case scenario to evaluate in vivo antiviral activity since time is given for the metabolization and accumulation of antiviral agents within cells targeted by virus prior to infection. To determine if prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb improved outcomes following MERS-CoV infection, we first confirmed that subcutaneous human equivalent doses (H.E.D.) of IFNb exerted a biological effect in mice. Administration of a 1 × , 2.5x, or 25x H.E.D. of mouse IFNb rapidly induced dose-dependent expression of interferon stimulated gene (ISG),

       <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">
        4

       ), we initiated IFNb dosing 2 h prior to MERS-CoV infection to maximize the potential antiviral effect. Similar to our previous studies, RDV (25 mg/kg, BID) or vehicle were administered subcutaneously every 12 h to obtain exposures in mice similar to that observed in humans

       ), vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb, or IFNb alone did not prevent weight loss (Fig.

       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">
        4a
       </xref>
       ), while those in LPV/RTV-IFNb low treated were modestly reduced (~4-fold, median = 5.5E + 03 pfu/lobe) as compared with its vehicle (median = 2.3E + 04 pfu/lobe) (

        P

       = &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test). To determine if initiation time or dose level would affect outcomes in the IFNb only group, we performed a similar study but administered IFNb at a lower dose (i.e., 1x H.E.D.) 24 h prior to infection (Supplementary Fig.
       <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">
        5
       </xref>
       ). Alteration of IFNb dose or time of administration did not improve outcomes from those in Fig.
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">
        4
       </xref>
       , and the modest improvement in virus titer seen with LPV/RTV-IFNb noted above was not observed. Taken together, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb caused modest reductions in lung viral load in one of two studies, but had minimal impact on other disease metrics while IFNb alone did not impact virus replication and exacerbated disease.

      Emerging viral diseases have caused significant global pandemics (e.g., HIV, 1918 influenza, smallpox), epidemics (e.g., SARS-CoV), and devastating outbreaks (e.g., EBOV, MERS-CoV). For CoV, metagenomic studies in wild animals have revealed a great diversity of viruses and hosts, and have even identified viruses similar to current and past epidemic strains in bats

      . Thus, broad-spectrum therapies effective against known epidemic and zoonotic strains likely to seed future emergence, have the potential to diminish epidemic disease today and diminish future outbreaks. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for any human CoV infection. Upon emergence of SARS- and MERS-CoV, patients were administered off-label antivirals (e.g., ribavirin, LPV, RTV) and immunomodulators (e.g., corticosteroids, interferon alpha-2a/2b, IFNb) as single agents or in combination in an attempt to ameliorate severe disease outcomes with very limited success

      . Without randomized controlled trials, determining efficacy is difficult due to patient and treatment variability as well as a lack of appropriate matching controls. Although recent meta-analysis and modeling has suggested that interferon treatment does not improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV patients

      . Here, we show that RDV provides superior antiviral activity against MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo as compared with LPV/RTV-IFNb. In addition, RDV was the only treatment to significantly reduce pulmonary pathology. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for RDV to treat MERS-CoV infections. Efficacy testing of antiviral regimens in humans like those in the MIRACLE trial are essential to progress antiviral development and prioritize therapies most likely to improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV patients.

Therefore, the evidence from several complementary histologic approaches demonstrate that RDV provides superior protection from ALI as compared with LPV/RTV-IFNb.

With therapeutic RDV, we observed decreased MERS-CoV pathogenesis and significant reductions in viral titers, yet therapeutic treatment did not completely abrogate disease. In addition, with high-titer virus inoculum, RDV was unable to prevent mortality and loss of pulmonary function although it did significantly reduce viral loads. These results are similar to those obtained for SARS-CoV, where therapeutic treatment initiated after peak virus titer and lung damage failed to improve outcomes yet significantly reduced viral titer

Since disease resulting from both SARS- and MERS-CoV infection is driven by both virus and host immune response factors, depending on the stage of the disease progression, early initiation of antiviral therapy, and/or holistic combination therapies will likely be needed to diminish virus replication, immunopathology, and/or promote repair and restoration of pulmonary homeostasis. Ongoing and future studies are aimed at determining if MERS-CoV is capable of generating resistance to RDV in vitro and whether the mutational spectra are similar to those obtained by MHV and SARS-CoV which shift EC

      In summary, we provide in vivo evidence of the potential utility of RDV in treating MERS-CoV patients. Overall, our work suggests that RDV may improve disease outcomes in CoV-infected patients, serve to protect health care workers in areas with endemic MERS-CoV and prove valuable in preventing future epidemics in the event of novel CoV emergence in the future.

       The primary goal of this study was to compare the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of RDV with the combination of LPV/RTV and IFNb. First, we assessed antiviral efficacy and cytoxicity in the Calu-3 human lung cell line as compared with the appropriate vehicle control. Experimental conditions in vitro were performed in sextuplicate unless otherwise stated, and antiviral assays were repeated four times per drug. Second, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of prophylactic RDV as compared to vehicle with two different doses of MERS-CoV in a new transgenic mouse model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis with improved pharmacokinetics for nucleotide prodrugs. We performed two additional prophylactic studies comparing RDV and vehicle to LPV/RTV-IFNb, IFNb-alone, and their vehicles. Third, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the above treatment regimens in a mouse model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, but did not include an IFNb, only arm and these studies were performed twice. All lung histological assessments were performed in a blinded manner. In addition, we performed a single therapeutic efficacy study with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. Our in vivo efficacy studies were designed to mirror the ongoing MIRACLE human clinical trial which is evaluating combination LPV/RTV-IFNb. Our studies were intended to generate the data required to justify further testing in nonhuman primates and collectively inform future human clinical trials. Mice were age- and sex-matched and randomly assigned into groups before infection and treatment. Exclusion criteria for in vivo studies were as follows: If a given mouse unexpectedly did not lose weight after infection and their virus lung titers were more than 2 log

RDV (i.e., GS-5734, stock at 20 mM) was serially diluted in 100% DMSO in twofold increments to obtain a ten-point dilution series. Human IFNb (R + D Systems, 200 µg/mL or 5.6 × 10

LPV (10 mM stock) and RTV (10 mM stock) were similarly diluted in DMSO, although various amounts of stock compound were added directly to media to obtain the top four dilutions in the ten-point curve (50 µM, 25 µM, 12.5 µM, 6.25 µM). To model the antiviral effect of the fixed dose combination of LPV/RTV used to treat HIV, we performed antiviral assays with a fixed combination of LPV/RTV (weight:weight ratio of 4:1 or molar ratio 4.6:1). The LPV/RTV combination was serially diluted in 100% DMSO in twofold increments, but mixture stock was added directly to the media similar to above to obtain the top four concentrations.

Thus, this study was aimed at determining if the maximal amount of LPV attainable in humans provided an additive or synergistic antiviral effect when combined with IFNb. All studies were performed in cell culture medium containing 10% FBS. DMSO (0.5%) was constant in all conditions.

To measure cytotoxicity, cells were exposed to the same drug dilutions and controls as the efficacy studies, but in the absence of virus infection. After 48 h of exposure, cell viability was determined by Cell-Titer-Glo Assay (Promega) and quantitated on a Spectramax. Similar data was obtained in at least three independent experiments.

Lung tissue sections were stained for cleaved caspase-3 antigen (1:500, Cell Signaling #9664) by the Animal Histopathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine Core at UNC. At the UNC Translational Pathology Laboratory (TPL) Core, stained slides were scanned on an Aperio ScanScope XT (Leica Biosystems) with a 20X power objective and a camera resolution of 0.4942 microns per pixel. Images were analyzed in Definiens Architect XD 2.7 with Tissue Studio version 4.4.2. Within each tissue section, total area was calculated. Single cells were detected initially based on hematoxylin staining of nuclei, and cell borders were interpolated in Tissue Studio. Each cell was then scored for cleaved caspase staining intensity based on a linear scale of Low, Medium, and High scale. The sum of the percent positive for high and medium caspase-3 staining was graphed for our studies. Tissue sections of diseased mouse intestine was used as a positive control.

      Dear Editor,

      In December 2019, a novel pneumonia caused by a previously unknown pathogen emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. The initial cases were linked to exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan.

      As of January 27, 2020, the Chinese authorities reported 2835 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 81 deaths. Additionally, 19 confirmed cases were identified in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and 39 imported cases were identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France, Australia and Canada. The pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is closely related to sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).

      Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed.
     </p>
     <p id="Par2">
      An efficient approach to drug discovery is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating related viral infections. The 2019-nCoV belongs to

       Betacoronavirus

      which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial.

      In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficiency of five FAD-approved drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir (GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in vitro.

      Standard assays were carried out to measure the effects of these compounds on the cytotoxicity, virus yield and infection rates of 2019-nCoVs. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of the candidate compounds in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) was determined by the CCK8 assay. Then, Vero E6 cells were infected with nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019

Efficacies were evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed with visualization of virus nucleoprotein (NP) expression through immunofluorescence microscopy at 48 h post infection (p.i.) (cytopathic effect was not obvious at this time point of infection).

        <p>
         A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19). Until today &gt;2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for &gt;8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

Active site residues D255 and D256 are in red for clarification (see the enlarged panel at the center of the figure). The active site is surface accessible as we can see from the surface representation allowing the interaction with the free nucleotides passing through the nucleotide channel of the RdRp. Although some insertions found in COVID-19 RdRp, these insertions are apart from the active site aspartates and have little effect on the model quality (see the Ramachandran plot). Additionally, the homology built model is minimized using the MM3 force field to ensure its reliability before performing the docking study.

As reflected from the docking scores, the eight compounds, including the physiological GTP and UTP and the four drugs IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir can bind to both COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps with good binding energy (−6.5 up to −9.0 kcal/mol). Despite SARS HCoV RdRp show slightly higher binding energies (lower in binding) compared to COVID-19 RdRp, the difference is still non-significant for Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir and its parent nucleotide, UTP. On average, 0.95 kcal/mol is the difference between the SARS and COVID-19 RdRps' binding energies for these compounds. On the other hand, the difference between COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps' binding energies to IDX-184 and its parent nucleotide GTP are 2.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, all the tested compounds show lower (better) binding energies to COVID-19 RdRp compared to SARS RdRp. The negative control compounds Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone both show lower binding affinities to either SARS or COVID-19 (higher than −5.6 kcal/mol).

       shows the formed interactions between the DAA drugs and COVID-19 RdRp after docking. The docking scores are listed under each complex to reflect the binding potency. Ligands are shown in orange sticks, while protein residues are in cyan stick representations labeled with its one-letter code. H-bonds are solid blue lines, while the dashed lines represent the hydrophobic interactions. Only one salt bridge (yellow spheres connected by a dashed line) is formed in the case of IDX-184 with D514, which is responsible for the increased stabilization of the formed complex, reflected on the docking score. The number of H-bonds for IDX-184, Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin are 11, 7, and 13, respectively. On the other hand, IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir both form metal interaction through the Mg

       with D652 (two interactions) and E702, respectively. This is another reason for the increased stabilization of the formed complexes for IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir. Additionally, Sofosbuvir formed two hydrophobic interactions with Y510 and D651 of the COVID-19 RdRp.

       To summarize the abovementioned data, we can say that IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin can tightly bind to the newly emerged coronavirus RdRp and hence contradict the function of the protein leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 show more promising results then comes Sofosbuvir as a potent inhibitor against the newly emerged COVID-19 strain of HCoV. Further optimization of these two compounds can result in a more potent compound able to stop the newly emerged infection.

      Conclusion
     </title>
     <p id="p0095">
      The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan city in China has a health concern since the last outbreak of these types of viruses (SARS) in the year 2002–2003 in the same country leaving &gt;700 deaths and 8000 cases in hospitals. Besides, another outbreak in the Middle East region has an entirely different infection pattern (MERS) leaving &gt;800 deaths and 2500 hospitalizations. The present study aimed to test and suggest possible inhibitors, DAA drugs, currently in the market stop the infection immediately. Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remdisivir can be used against the new strain of coronavirus that emerged with promising results. GTP derivatives may be used as specific inhibitors against COVID-19.

        The novel coronavirus infection that initially found at the end of 2019 has attracted great attention. So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no “specific drug” available. Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”. China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.

      Introduction
     </title>
     <p id="p0010">
      The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a newly-emerged human infectious coronavirus. Since December 2019, it has spread rapidly in China in a short period of time. As of March 17, 2020, there have been 81116 confirmed cases and 3231 deaths. It has also outbreak in other countries, such as Korea, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and Iran, with a total of 85296 cases confirmed. Due to it is a newly-emerged virus, researchers have taken quick actions to isolate the virus and perform gene sequencing, making identifying treatments possible. Even so, it takes time to develop new drugs and vaccines, as well as to explore biotherapeutics, thus it is unlikely to be applied to patients with urgent need. Therefore, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a viable solution. The SARS-CoV-2 is 80% homologous with the acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which also broke out in China in 2002, and some enzymes are even more than 90% homologous [

      ]. Consequently, we are expecting to find drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 from the experience of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Some drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">
       2
      </xref>
      ], within the selection range of “conventional drug in new use”. Through clinical treatment of the COVID-19, it has been found that neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), ganciclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin are ineffectual and not recommended for clinical application [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. When we set our sights on the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we found that a drug unlisted, remdesivir, has demonstrated strength in trials related to MERS-CoV and Ebola virus infection. In the United States, the first patient with COVID-19 has shown significant improvement in clinical symptoms within 24 h of treatment with remdesivir. This case has convinced the public that remdesivir could become a new “specific drug” for COVID-19. This article starts from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of infection of the SARS-CoV-2, and then analyzes the feasibility of conducting trials and putting into clinical use of COVID-19 from the pharmacological characteristics and successful cases of remdesivir.

       Structure and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      </title>
      <p id="p0015">
       SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single, and positive stranded RNA virus. The virus particles are round or oval in shape, with a diameter about 60–140 nm. Based on sequence analysis, it shows that the novel coronavirus belongs to Beta coronavirus Lineage β, Sarbecovirus, where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are included. However, it forms a new clade different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and becomes the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">

       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p id="p0020">
       SARS-CoV-2 shows the typical beta coronavirus organization: 5′ untranslated region (UTR), replication enzyme coding region, S gene, E gene, M gene, N gene, 3’ UTR, and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">
        Fig. 1

       ) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">
        4
       </xref>
       ]. The replication enzyme coding region mainly expresses and encodes two large genes: ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 ~ nsp16) that are highly conserved throughout the coronavirus. S gene, M gene, E gene, and N gene respectively encode four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is the receptor binding site, which is on the viral surface; The M protein shapes the virions, promotes membrane curvature, and is responsible for the transport of nutrients across cell membranes; the E protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virus, and is involved in viral pathogenesis; the N protein can bind virus RNA genome and maintain its stability [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">
        5
       </xref>
       ]. Among them, S protein plays a key role in virus recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors, and mediating the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">
        6
       </xref>
       ]. Through the analysis of the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it shares 40% sequence similarity with MERS-CoV and 80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is more compatible with SARS-CoV [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
        7
       </xref>
       ]. In addition, by performing systematic structural simulations and immunogenicity scans of the S proteins of all coronaviruses, as well as calculating the immunogenic distance between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus subtypes, it can be concluded that the immunogenicity of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to that of SARS-CoV [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">
        8
       </xref>
       ]. It is known that SARS-CoV enters target cells by binding the S protein to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, which is triggered by the cell serine protease TMPRSS2 [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
        9
       </xref>
       ]. In view of the 76% amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">
        10
       </xref>
       ], we can speculate that the novel coronavirus may have a similar function to SARS-CoV, which has been preliminary proved in bioinformatics prediction methods as well as in vitro tests [

       Previous studies have shown that 4 of the 5 key amino acids of the S protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the target cells have changed. It was suspected it may affect the affinity of the S protein to ACE2 receptor, and in turn affect the spread of the virus among the public [

       ]. However, through calculation methods of molecular structure simulation, the interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV and the ACE2 receptor has perfectly maintained in a holistic manner [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">
        11

       The pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19

       COVID-19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease, and the most common symptoms at onset are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, partly with nausea, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has milder clinical symptoms and lower fatality [

       Similar to SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface to facilitate the virus entering the host cell; then the virus exposes its RNA, translates its RNA replicase, and forms an RNA replicase-transcriptase complex. Through transcription and replication, the complex forms RNA negative strands that will be translated for the structural proteins of the virus later. Then the structural proteins and RNA in the cytoplasm assemble into new viral particles, which are released from infected cells by exocytosis to infect other cells (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       ). Each infected cell produces thousands of novel viral particles that spread to bronchi, eventually reach the alveoli, and extrapulmonary organs, causing pneumonia and targeted organic infections. However, the ACE2 receptor is not only expressed in the respiratory organs. It has been reported that, by using the RNA-seq method to express ACE2 receptors in human tissues, the number of ACE2 receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (high in esophagus, small intestine, and colon, but low in stomach), kidneys, and testes is nearly 100 times higher than that in the lung [

       ], suggesting that these tissues may also be the target organs for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. It may explain why some patients with COVID-19 developed other system injuries clinically besides respiratory system injuries. Furthermore, it have been found that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection is positive in the feces of some patients, indicating that there may be live virus in the feces, and the digestive system may be a potential route for COVID-19 [

       In COVID-19, in addition to the direct damages caused by the virus, the indirect immune injuries caused by the injured tissues also attract great concern, which may be related to the severity and fatality of the disease. Previous studies have shown that pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung injury in patients with SARS are associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1) in serum [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">
        17

       ]. And it has been reported that the MERS-CoV infection induced elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations (such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-15, and IL-17) in serum [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">
        18
       </xref>
       ]. We note that patients with COVID-19 also have high levels of IL-1β, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1 in their serum, leading to activation of the Th1 cell responses. Furthermore, the concentrations of GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α in ICU patients were higher than those in non-ICU patients, indicating that cytokine storms were associated with disease severity. Apart from this, SARS-CoV-2 infection also activates the secretion of cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) in Th2 cell responses that suppress inflammation, which is different from SARS-CoV infection [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">
        17

       ]. Further researches are needed to investigate the responses of Th1 and Th2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

       Currently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is unclear.

       T lymphocytes, accounting for to a certain degree of immune injury in patients. This over activation not only failed to establish an immune response, but also caused tissue injuries, mostly manifested as severe injury in the lungs, and some patients died of multiple organ failure. This situation further accelerates the deterioration and shortens the course of the disease, hampering the establishment of fully adaptive immune response. The immunopathological injuries caused by the over activation also provides us with an idea for treating COVID-19, for example, we can probably apply the IL-17 inhibitor (secukinwmab) directed against Th17 cell activation, but it still need more exploration. Also, vaccines are also one of the solutions to make up for the lack of adaptive immune response.

       The latest study terms that the changes of viral nucleic acid in patients with COVID-19 is similar to that in patients with influenza, but different from those with SARS. Viral load can be detected not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic patients, pointing out the potential for virus transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. These findings are coherent with reports evidencing that the virus transmission may have occurred early in infectious processes, illustrating that case detection and isolation may require a different strategy from that required to control SARS-CoV [

       In the Ces1c (−/−) mouse SARS model, the preventive treatment trial of remdesivir achieved satisfactory results. Administering 1 day after the onset of the disease, lung virus titers decreased significantly, with improvements on pulmonary function. Administering 2 days after the onset, the pulmonary virus titer can be obviously reduced, but the survival rate of mice is still relatively low. This study implied that when the pulmonary injuries reach the maximum, simply reducing the virus titer can no longer suppress the strong immune responses in mice, also showing that administering before the peak of virus replication can significantly improve symptoms of the infected mice [

In a rhesus monkey model infected with MERS-CoV, treating with remdesivir 24 h before infection can completely prevent symptoms caused by MERS-CoV, strongly inhibit viral replications in the respiratory tract, and prevent the formation of pulmonary lesions. Administering remdesivir 12 h after infection provides clear clinical benefits, reducing clinical symptoms, lung virus replication, and lung lesions [

       Pharmacokinetic experiments in cynomolgus monkeys showed the first-pass effect of oral remdesivir resulted in a low bioavailability of the drug. Intramuscular injection of 3 mg/kg had a 50% survival rate compared with the control group. Administering intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, remdesivir rapidly decomposed into the original drug (nucleoside phosphate) in rhesus monkeys. Within 2 h, remdesivir quickly distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and soon afterwards activated to nucleoside triphosphate to reach a peak, with a survival rate of 100% [

Intravenous infusion of 150 mg of a remdesivir solution repeated 1 h per day showed a linear pharmacokinetics over a period of 14 days. After intravenously injecting 75 and 150 mg of remdesivir solution formulations over 2 h, the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of a lyophilized formulation. Intravenous infusion of 75 mg of drug over 30 min provides similar levels of parent drug exposure to the same dose over 2 h (

In clinical trials of anti-Ebola drugs, the fatality rate of patients in the experimental group using remdesivir was 53%, and the efficacy was significantly worse than that of the two monoclonal antibodies MAb114 (fatality rate 35%) and REGN-EB3 (fatality rate 33%) [

Nevertheless, in consideration of Ebola's high lethality and monoclonal antibodies with more obvious therapeutic effects, when there are merely 175 patients injected remdesivir, we cannot assume remdesivir of no avail. The small sample size is not enough to deny the effect of remdesivir. Moreover, receptors of Ebola virus are widely distributed in vivo, not only to the respiratory tract, but also to the digestive tract, urinary tract, and blood system, etc., causing mortally hemorrhagic fever; in addition, Ebola virus persists in the eyes and central nervous system for long [

       It is worth noting that from the data in the article, it can be found the viral load of patients has decreased before remdesivir injection (

       ), which is not described in detail in the original report. It's known that the viral infection is self-limiting, and the patient is a mild to moderate infectious case with a controlled fever in time, thus it is possible that his recovery is related to the role of self-defense mechanisms and supportive treatment as well. It cannot be inferred that the improvement of patients' condition after taking the drug is definitely connected to remdesivir. Whether there is a link between the improvement of the symptoms and the drug is worth further consideration.

       Clinical symptoms, especially respiratory symptoms, have been improved significantly within 24 h, bringing hope for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. For COVID-19 no specific medication is available, remdesivir is expected to be a “specific drug”. However, for the acute infectious diseases, reducing the number of viral copies in the body is the key point. Also, the efficacy of the drug should be focused on the pharmacokinetics and kinetics data of COVID-19 in the ongoing phase III clinical trials.

       Feasibility of trials on remdesivir on COVID-19
      </title>
      <p id="p0100">
       The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan constituted an epidemic threat in China. The World Health Organization announced it a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. During the outbreak, the number of confirmed cases in China showed an exponential growth. The people and the government of the country tried their best to fight the epidemic with soaring combat mood. The nation's enthusiasm to fight the epidemic provides the trials on COVID-19 a favorable environment. At the same time, Article 23 of China's new Drug Administration Law, which came into effect on December 1, 2019, has enabled the “Compassionate Use” to develop adaptively in China. Two clinical trials on remdesivir have passed the most stringent ethical review of the 74 projects. On February 5, 2020 the trial has officially launched with experimental drugs provided by Gilead Sciences for free in China by professor Chen Wang, an academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, an internationally renowned respiratory expert who successfully suggested Chinese Government building “Fang Cang” hospitals to cure more than 10 thousand mild or prepatent COVID-19 patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">
        32
       </xref>
       ]. Due to the large number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China with no effective drugs, it is easy to collect clinical samples for trials theoretically. However, the rigor of the included samples hindered recruitment. As public attach more attention on prevention and treatment, fewer patients meet stringent inclusion criteria, resulting in a slow recruitment process. Another reason is that there are plenty of drugs in the clinical trials, speeding up the patients' leaving hospital. Nevertheless, it has been reported that more severe patients have been recruited, which provides favorable conditions for the trial of the severe group, and as a result, at least, it can be rapidly applied to the clinical treatment of severe patients in the near future. The need of treatment on COVID-19 is urgent, so if the results of clinical trials prove it has the potential to benefit the treatment, according to China's “Compassionate Use”, remdesivir will be more immediately used in patients with severe illness. Meanwhile, the opening of green channels under special circumstances to speed up the review and approval process of the drug approval center will undoubtedly help save the lives of critical patients and promote the developing of “specific drugs”. In the absence of clinical trial results, it is still difficult to put remdesivir into large scale clinical use [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">
        33
       </xref>
       ]. With the political support, the rapid development of clinical trials on remdesivir is imperative.

       A drug, GS-441524 (compound A,
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">

       </xref>
       A) for treating feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by coronavirus infection in cats has been tested in cats. Its safety and effectiveness in treating FIP have been proven [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">
        34
       </xref>
       ], with FDA's approval. It can be seen from the structure that remdesivir is phosphorylated from GS-441524, with identical target RdRp (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       ). It is noteworthy that though coronavirus reproduces more than 20 generations in GS-441524 yields resistance, the resistant virus is still sensitive to high concentrations of remdesivir and the fitness of the resistant virus has reduced to the same level as wild-type MERS-CoV [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">
        35
       </xref>
       ], which avoids resistant mutant coronaviruses from producing resistant supervirus. At the beginning of developing remdesivir, Gilead Science selected a large number of nucleosides or their prodrugs to conduct in vitro growth inhibition experiments on Ebola-infected human microvascular endothelial cells in the laboratory and found compound A showed inhibitory activity (EC

       = 0.78 μM), and the compound A was GS-441524. Thereafter, on the basis of Compound A, after examining the activity and toxicity of compounds surrounding Compound A, modifying the prodrug, and optimizing amino acids and acyl groups, the cynomolgus monkey performs a pharmacokinetic test to select a structure such as GS-5734 (

       </xref>
       ]. Although in phase II it was not as effective as competitive drugs and clinical trials were terminated, remdesivir showed good safety and pharmacokinetics in both phases I and II clinical trials. COVID-19 has once again brought remdesivir to the stage of clinical trials. Whether the results of phase III clinical trial will make its comeback to the stage is worthy of expectation.

       Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated human tolerance to remdesivir. Of the 175 patients in the phase II clinical trial administering remdesivir, 9 were reported to have serious adverse reactions, 8 of whom were considered not related to drugs, and 1 with severe hypotension was thought to be drug-related, but still not confirmed [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">

       </xref>
       ]. The GS-441524, a drug used to treat FIP, has shown a high degree of safety in feline trials as well. The focal injection site reactions only showed in immediate pain with vocalization, occasional growling, and postural changes lasting for 30–60s. These initial reactions were relieved after the owners became more adept at administering the injection. Except for a cat with a slight increase in urea nitrogen and SDMA of the third round of treatment, no other symptoms of systemic poisoning were observed [

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">

       Coronaviruses must replicate nucleic acids to generate new progeny virus after entering human cells. SARS-CoV-2 is known to be single stranded RNA virus, so RdRp must be used to replicate nucleic acids. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogues, act as RdRp inhibitor, can provide a scheme for blocking RNA replication. Related studies have found that it plays a role in the final stage of entering the cell, which is consistent with its expected mode of action. Wuhan Virus Research Institute carried out a vitro inhibition test and found that remdesivir can block virus infection at very low micromolar concentration of Vero E6 cells infected with virus, and the cell selectivity is high (EC

Based on the effectiveness in previous researches, although there are many unknowns and limits of remdesivir, the phase III clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 are not only a fight against this epidemic, but also of strategic importance to reserve more effective antiviral drugs for the future.

      Conclusion
     </title>
     <p id="p0120">
      Strategic reservation for antiviral drugs will avoid the difficulty of medicine unavailable when an outbreak comes again. Remdesivir's situational and political superiority, as well as its previous research results and application effects make it imperative to carry out the clinical trials focusing on the SARS-CoV-2. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is easy to mutate, the rapid starting of clinical trials is undoubtedly a right choice to prevent the resistance mutation due to blind medication. It has been covered in the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General’s opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 on February 20, 2020 that the two clinical trials on remdesivir of therapeutics prioritized by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint are expected preliminary results in three weeks. On February 24, the WHO cast a vote of confidence for Gilead Sciences' experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, indicating that remdesivir has great potential and may be the best candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. Whatever the progress of the clinical trials is, we are expecting that the clinical trials of remdesivir, a starring drug, would bring outstanding breakthroughs to the treatment of COVID-19, or more promisingly, other virus infection in the future.

        Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies. In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on
        <italic>
         in vitro
        </italic>
        and
        <italic>
         in vivo
        </italic>
        studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.

      Introduction

     <p id="p0005">
      The first human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were identified in the 1960s [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">
       1
      </xref>
      ], and for the majority of the past six decades, HCoVs have generally maintained a relatively innocuous reputation as a cause of the common cold [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. However, public perception and awareness of HCoVs has shifted considerably in the last twenty years, with the onset of three high profile outbreaks that have garnered international attention and have subsequently led to renewed interest in potential therapeutic options for HCoV-related illnesses. In 2002–2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected more than 8000 people, reaching 26 countries and resulting in a 10% case fatality rate [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. In the ~7 years between April 2012 and November 2019, there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that reached 27 countries and had a mortality rate of approximately 34% [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">
       4
      </xref>
      ], though serologic studies have implied that the prevalence of MERS-CoV may have been underestimated [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. Most recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan and its subsequent spread to over 160 countries across the world has generated intense interest in vaccine development and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [

      subfamily, there are four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. Viruses in this family can infect a wide variety of host species, such as birds, humans, and non-human mammals, including dromedary camels, alpacas, domestic pigs, dogs, cats, ferrets, minks, and bats [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">
       23
      </xref>
      ]. Although the infectivity of most strains is host species-specific, host range is wide across different CoVs, and some bat CoVs rely on the same host receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; ACE-2) as human CoVs to facilitate entry into cells [

Among patients with URIs severe enough to warrant hospitalization, one study found that approximately 5% of cases were attributable to rhinoviruses or HCoVs, but a substantial proportion of these hospitalized patients had underlying pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities that may have exacerbated their conditions [

      Remdesivir mechanism of action
     </title>
     <p id="p0035">
      As a nucleoside analog, remdesivir acts as an RdRp inhibitor, targeting the viral genome replication process. The RdRp is the protein complex CoVs use to replicate their RNA-based genomes. After the host metabolizes remdesivir into active NTP, the metabolite competes with adenosine triphosphate (ATP; the natural nucleotide normally used in this process) for incorporation into the nascent RNA strand [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">
       32
      </xref>
      ]. The incorporation of this substitute into the new strand results in premature termination of RNA synthesis, halting the growth of the RNA strand after a few more nucleotides are added. Although CoVs have a proofreading process that is able to detect and remove other nucleoside analogs, rendering them resistant to many of these drugs, remdesivir seems to outpace this viral proofreading activity, thus maintaining antiviral activity [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0150">
       30
      </xref>
      ]. Unsurprisingly, Agostini et al. reported that a mutant murine hepatitis virus (MHV) devoid of proofreading ability was more sensitive to remdesivir [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">
       13
      </xref>
      ]. The opposite is also possible—that mutations that improve proofreading or otherwise increase fidelity of the base-pairing process may result in remdesivir resistance [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0165">
       33
      </xref>
      ]. In fact, Agostini et al. also induced mutations in MHV (through passage in remdesivir) that conferred strong resistance against the drug, but these mutated strains were outcompeted by wild-type MHV in coinfected cell cultures that were not exposed to remdesivir [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">
       13
      </xref>
      ]. How well this experiment would represent a situation in which a resistance mutation developed naturally, though, is unclear. Nonetheless, some evidence suggests that remdesivir could have an additional mechanism of action that has yet to be discovered, which, if true, may allow for partial antiviral activity to continue despite viral mutations that enhance replication fidelity [

      Summary of studies on remdesivir and coronaviruses
     </title>
     <p id="p0040">
      The existing studies on the potential antiviral effects of remdesivir that are of highest relevance to the virus underlying the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, are those that have been conducted on genetically similar coronaviruses. As discussed above, within the
      <italic>
       Coronaviridae
      </italic>
      family of viruses, there is a substantial amount of genetic heterogeneity, even among human strains [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0170">
       34
      </xref>
      ]. This genetic diversity is posited to be attributable to the large viral genome and the molecular nuances of the viral RNA replication processes (

       e.g.
      </italic>
      , RdRp infidelity) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0105">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. Although remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral, its efficacy against other families of viruses may not be generalizable to its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, and attempts to predict the level of potential generalizability are hampered by the possibility that the drug may have secondary mechanisms of action that are yet to be elucidated. As a result, this review focuses on studies of the effects of remdesivir on CoVs specifically; however, some information about research on other lesser related viruses (
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      , Ebola) is briefly mentioned for additional context on the drug.

       studies have also investigated the utility of remdesivir against non-human CoVs. For example, a study by Murphy et al. reported anti-CoV activity of remdesivir's parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against an alphacoronavirus that only infects wild and domestic cats, the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (EC

        14
       </xref>
       ]. In 2019, Brown et al. observed some antiviral effects of remdesivir against SARS-like bat CoVs (specifically, Bat-CoV HKU3, Bat-CoV SCH014, and Bat-CoV WIV1) and MERS-like bat CoVs (specifically, Bat-CoV HKU5) [

       Further, this study detected a weaker antiviral effect against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV;
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ), particularly when tested in porcine cell lines. Among currently known CoVs, PDCoV has the least similar RdRp sequence compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (only 67–69% similarity in amino acid sequence) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">
        12
       </xref>
       ]. In fact, the RdRp of PDCoV has a different amino acid at a specific site (phenylalanine to leucine at residue 483), a dissimilarity that has been previously associated with increased resistance to remdesivir in other CoVs [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">

       ]. Therefore, it was important to attempt to disentangle whether the lower antiviral activity observed could be related to a viral characteristic of PDCoV or if it could be attributable to differences in the cell lines used. While diminished potency of remdesivir against PDCoV was noted in cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), in a human liver cell line (Huh7), the EC

       </sub>
       was substantially higher for antiviral activity against an endemic HCoV (229E) in the porcine cell line (3.8 μM compared to 0.02 μM in Huh7), again indicating the likely lower potency of the drug in this context. Thus, the observed variations in remdesivir potency against the same viruses in the different cell lines may imply that there is some factor associated with the cell line, rather than the virus, that may be affecting the drug's antiviral activity. In fact, the authors state that these findings may imply that LLC-PK1 cells lack a cellular process necessary for remdesivir antiviral activity, which could also support the hypothesis that remdesivir may have another mechanism of action that is not presently understood.

For example, using a mouse model with a Ces1c-knockout (which better emulates human metabolism of remdesivir compared to wild-type mice) and a humanized MERS-CoV receptor, Sheahan et al. found that both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir had protective effects against MERS-CoV replication and associated pathology, generally resulting in less lung damage and better pulmonary function compared to controls [

       , more plaque-forming units), those receiving prophylactic remdesivir one day before infection had significantly better 6-day survival than infected control mice that did not receive remdesivir. However, the mice were sacrificed before longer follow-up data could be obtained. Similarly, in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir demonstrated favorable results, reducing respiratory tract viral titers and pulmonary pathology [

       ]. Prophylactic use was initiated 24 h prior to viral challenge, whereas therapeutic use was initiated 12 h after challenge. While respiratory rate was not substantially different between the prophylactic, therapeutic, and control groups, x-ray scores, representing the severity of pulmonary infiltrates, were significantly better in the prophylactic and therapeutic groups, comparing each to controls [

If disease recurred after initial treatment, cats were re-treated using the same regimen for another 2 weeks. Follow-up continued for 8 months. All treated cats demonstrated favorable responses to GS-441524 treatment within 24–48 h, regardless of dose, and were still alive and clinically unremarkable 8 months post infection. Two cats (one from each dose group) experienced disease recurrence at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after initial treatment and were re-treated. Adverse events related to treatment, other than temporary discomfort at the injection site, were not observed. This study was based on a small number of animals, and it is unclear whether experimental infection is a relevant representation of naturally-occurring FIPV infection in cats. Future studies with additional follow-up time would be helpful for assessing whether unexpected long-term sequelae are observed in the cats, since such information on surviving animals is sparse given the high fatality rate.

       In a field trial of treatment with GS-441524 for naturally occurring FIP, Pedersen et al. treated 31 cats with an initial dose of 2 mg/kg daily [

       ]. Within the first week of treatment, 4 cats (13%) with severe disease died or were euthanized, a fifth cat died after 26 days, and another was euthanized about 2-weeks post relapse due to the development of neurological signs and a lack of response to treatment. The remaining cats completed at least 12 weeks of treatment, but 8 experienced relapses requiring re-treatment with GS-441524. Dose escalation from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg daily was required for 5 cats. A total of 25 treated cats (81%) survived FIP for at least 44 weeks of follow up, indicating that GS-441524 (and presumably, its prodrug remdesivir) is also a promising therapeutic candidate for treatment of alphacoronavirus-related disease in cats. Most cats in this study had “wet” or effusive FIP, the hallmark of which is the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal or thoracic cavities. There were only 3 cats in the study with abdominal non-effusive (“dry”) FIP, which is a more chronic condition, and another 4 cats initially had dry FIP that progressed into wet FIP. One cat in the dry FIP group and one in the dry-to-wet group did not survive. Because of the small number of cats with dry FIP, conclusions cannot be drawn about whether remdesivir has greater efficacy in the treatment of some clinical manifestations of FIP than others. A strength of this study is that it was conducted among animals with naturally-occurring CoV infection as a field trial, better representing real-world circumstances.

       The first patient to present with COVID-19 in the U.S. was treated with intravenous remdesivir under the compassionate use clause after developing pneumonia in January 2020 [

He was treated with intravenous remdesivir on the seventh day, and his condition was reportedly improving on the eighth day. No adverse events related to remdesivir use were noted. The case report was written prior to the patient's discharge.
      </p>
      <p id="p0095">
       Human data on remdesivir use for COVID-19 will likely continue to become available from compassionate use cases before the clinical trial is completed. In fact, there are many anecdotal reports already circulating about treatment of COVID-19 patients with remdesivir. According to a recent newspaper article, 17 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship were treated with intravenous remdesivir for 10 days and were alive at the time of article release. One of the physicians involved in their treatment, who is affiliated with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), felt that the patients were less dependent on ventilators after receiving the drug. Nevertheless, no conclusions can be drawn based on such reports.

       A preprint of a case series on the first 12 COVID-19 patients in the U.S. (who had disease onset between January 14 and 29, 2020) recently became available, though it had not been peer-reviewed at the time of writing [

This report, authored by a team from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), described the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as information on course of disease and clinical management. Seven of the 12 patients (58%) were hospitalized, and three of these patients received remdesivir intravenously at the onset of worsening symptoms (two on the eleventh day of illness and one on the seventh day). Treatment with remdesivir was tolerated, though temporary gastrointestinal upset and elevated aminotransferase levels were observed in all three patients after administration. Treatment was discontinued after respiratory symptoms improved (total treatment durations of 4 days, 5 days, and 10 days). It should be noted that one of these three patients is the same patient described in the case report discussed above [

Interestingly, patients who received remdesivir had slower rates of viral clearance compared to patients who received single-dose antivirals (specifically, MAb114 and REGN-EB3), which the authors hypothesized may be related to the fact that the treatment plan for remdesivir involved multiple intravenous infusions.

       may not have clinical utility if the therapeutic dose induces severe adverse events in the patient. Alternatively, if the treatment dose does not attain an effective serum concentration in patients, or if EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       is greater than the achievable maximum serum concentration (C

        max
       </sub>
       ), then the drug is less likely to have therapeutic utility. With regard to animal models, how closely the model represents disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism in humans can be challenging to gauge.

The NIH-sponsored clinical trial, ongoing in the U.S. and the Republic of Korea, is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in which patients are randomized to receive either placebo or an initial dose of 200 mg of intravenous remdesivir on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg per day, through discharge up to a maximum of 10 total treatment days [

      Conclusions
     </title>
     <p id="p0125">
      While previous studies on remdesivir are promising, formal clinical evaluation is strongly warranted. In general, there are many reasons why favorable preclinical data can fail to translate directly into human clinical trial results [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0230">
       46
      </xref>
      ], such as inadvertent use of irrelevant models, inability to achieve effective serum drug concentrations in patients, or the occurrence of unanticipated severe adverse events among patients. Therefore, postulating on expected results of the trials is extremely challenging.
     </p>
     <p id="p0130">
      Nonetheless, there are hundreds of clinical trials ongoing internationally on different drugs that utilize various mechanisms of action [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">
       41
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0255">
       51
      </xref>
      ], including trials on other nucleosides inhibitors (
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      , ribavirin), protease inhibitors (
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      , lopinavir/ritonavir), and interleukin-6 receptor inhibitors (
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      , sarilumab) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">
       41
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0235">
       47
      </xref>
      ]. Another well-known candidate that is being evaluated in multiple trials against COVID-19 is chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), which is already approved as an antimalarial (and for extraintestinal amebiasis) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">
       41
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0240">
       48
      </xref>
      ]. Results of the clinical trials currently underway in the U.S. and China will provide crucial information about whether remdesivir represents a viable treatment option for COVID-19 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0100">
       20
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0245">
       49
      </xref>
      ]. If the trial findings are ultimately positive, it will be imperative to ensure that the drug is produced on a commercial scale capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Such a change in production may also allow for the added benefit of the drug becoming more available for agricultural and veterinary use for relevant indications.

        Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1′-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2′-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2′-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.

     </title>
     <p>
      Infection with negative-sense RNA viruses is associated with a broad spectrum of human diseases. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are recognized as widespread global pathogens, while others, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Lassa virus (LASV), or Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) are known for sporadic outbreaks, their high epidemic potential, and their high mortality rates [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-viruses-11-00326">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. Negative-sense RNA viruses are classified into segmented and non-segmented viruses. Segmented negative-sense RNA viruses are further subdivided into families that contain two single-stranded genome fragments such as the
      <italic>
       Arenaviridae
      </italic>
      (e.g., LASV), three fragments such as the order
      <italic>
       Bunyavirals
      </italic>
      (formerly the family
      <italic>
       Bunyaviridae
      </italic>
      , e.g., CCHFV), or multiple fragments such as the
      <italic>
       Orthomyxoviridae
      </italic>
      (e.g., influenza). Examples of families of non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome (
      <italic>
       Mononegavirales
      </italic>
      ) include the
      <italic>
       Filoviridae
      </italic>
      (e.g., EBOV), the
      <italic>
       Paramyxoviridae
      </italic>
      (e.g., Nipah virus (NiV)), and the
      <italic>
       Pneumoviridae
      </italic>
      (e.g., RSV).
     </p>

      Prevention and treatment of infection with negative-sense RNA viruses remain challenging. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa caused approximately 28,000 cases and 11,310 deaths and is a sober reminder of an unmet medical need [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-viruses-11-00326">
       2
      </xref>
      ]. Intensive research efforts during that outbreak led to the discovery and development of several vaccine and drug candidates. Promising experimental vaccines against EBOV are based on the envelope glycoprotein as the antigenic target [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-viruses-11-00326">
       3
      </xref>
      ]. Monoclonal antibodies and nucleotide analogue inhibitors represent investigational therapies. ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies that target the EBOV glycoprotein [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-viruses-11-00326">
       4
      </xref>
      ], was shown to reverse EVD in non-human primates [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-viruses-11-00326">
       5
      </xref>
      ]. However, results from a randomized clinical trial were inconclusive [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-viruses-11-00326">
       6
      </xref>
      ]. Like glycoprotein-based vaccines, the antibody cocktail is also not effective against all ebolavirus species [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-viruses-11-00326">

      ]. In contrast, several nucleotide analogues show antiviral activity against different ebolavirus species and also other negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses [

      Favipiravir (T-705) is a nucleoside precursor that has been approved for treatment of pandemic influenza in Japan [

      </xref>
      ]. Intracellular phosphoribosylation yields a triphosphate form (T-705-RTP) that is accommodated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f001">
       Figure 1

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-viruses-11-00326">
       20
      </xref>
      ]. Experiments with recombinant influenza RdRp show ambiguous base-pairing with both cytidine and uridine, which can lead to lethal mutagenesis [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-viruses-11-00326">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. Incorporation of the T-705-RTP into the growing RNA chain can also cause moderate inhibition of RNA synthesis. Favipiravir is active against a large panel of RNA viruses in vitro, including EBOV [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-viruses-11-00326">
       24
      </xref>
      ]. The structure of the base moiety and proposed mechanism of action are reminiscent of ribavirin that has been used for over a decade to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f001">

      ]. A structurally distinct broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is also active against EBOV in vitro is galidesivir (BCX4430) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-viruses-11-00326">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. Galidesivir is an adenosine-like compound with a nitrogen-substituted sugar ring that likewise requires intracellular activation to the TP form (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f001">
       Figure 1
      </xref>
      ). Biochemical experiments show that this compound serves as a substrate for the RdRp of HCV and causes chain termination following its incorporation [

       10

      ]. The biochemical data obtained with purified recombinant RSV RdRp and a recent study with NiV RdRp point to delayed chain termination as a possible mechanism of action [

      </xref>
      ]. Delayed chain termination refers to inhibition of RNA synthesis a few residues downstream of the incorporated inhibitor. However, the inhibition results have yet to be translated in quantitative terms and data with recombinant EBOV RdRp are lacking. RSV, NiV, and EBOV are non-segmented viruses that share similar requirements for RNA synthesis [

The amount of RSV and h-mtRNAP was optimized to have the similar apparent activity as EBOV RdRp by testing various amounts of enzymes. This involved employing low-micromolar concentrations of NTP substrates in RNA synthesis reactions containing h-mtRNAP.

       A short model primer/template can serve as a substrate for EBOV RdRp and other viral RdRp enzymes (

       ]. This system mimics a random elongation complex that allows the evaluation of nucleotide analogue inhibitors. To elucidate the mechanism of action of remdesivir, we initially assessed whether remdesivir-TP was able to compete with its natural counterpart ATP (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f002">
        Figure 2

       B). Extension of the primer was monitored with [α-
       <sup>
        32
       </sup>
       P]GTP that serves as the first substrate in the reaction. The next site of incorporation, referred to as i, allows binding of ATP or the inhibitor remdesivir-TP. Full-length product formation requires the simultaneous presence of ATP and CTP. RNA synthesis was analyzed with three different concentrations of the natural substrates ATP and CTP (1 μM, 10 μM, and 100 μM) (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f002">
        Figure 2
       </xref>
       B). Increasing concentrations of the inhibitor at each of the three substrate concentrations yielded changes in product patterns that become evident at position i+1. The particular template allows ATP or remdesivir-TP binding at both positions i and i+1. The slower migrating band at position i+1 is indicative of the inhibitor’s incorporation. Most significant differences are seen with the lowest concentration of ATP (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f002">
        Figure 2
       </xref>
       B, left panel). Higher concentrations of ATP promote synthesis of faster migrating products that do not contain the nucleotide analogue (

        Figure 2
       </xref>
       B, middle and right panels). These gradual changes demonstrate competition between ATP and remdesivir-TP. Subsequent RNA products between positions i+2 and i+5 show even more complex shifts as a consequence of multiple competition events. However, a significant reduction in RNA synthesis is not evident under these conditions. We therefore employed a systematic, quantitative approach to evaluate the inhibitory effects of remdesivir-TP.

       (remdesivir-MP) defines the selectivity. Selectivity values of ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp demonstrate that remdesivir-TP is almost as efficiently used as ATP. In contrast, human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) discriminates against the inhibitor (

        Figure 3

       B,C). The high selectivity value of ~500 shows that incorporation of the inhibitor is inefficient (

       3.3. Chain Termination
      </title>
      <p>
       The incorporated nucleotide analogue inhibitor can potentially affect incorporation of the next nucleotide. However, the presence of a 3′-hydroxyl group in remdesivir-TP would theoretically allow the nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate of an incoming nucleotide. To quantify a possible kinetic effect of remdesivir on subsequent incorporation events, we terminated the primer with AMP and remdesivir-MP and measured rates of incorporation of the natural UTP substrate at position i+1 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f004">
        Figure 4
       </xref>
       A). For EBOV RdRp, both primers were utilized with the same efficiency (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f004">
        Figure 4
       </xref>
       B). In contrast, the results with RSV RdRp show that the rate of UMP incorporation is ~6-fold reduced when the 3′-end of the primer contains remdesivir-MP (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f004">

       <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-11-00326-t002">

       ). This difference is primarily driven by a higher K
       <sub>
        m
       </sub>
       value. The maximum rate of product formation (V
       <sub>
        max
       </sub>
       ) is almost identical at saturating concentrations of substrate. Hence, the obstacle can be overcome and chain termination is unlikely a possible mechanism of action for both enzymes. At most, the RSV enzyme seems to pause following incorporation of remdesivir-MP.

       3.4. Delayed Chain Termination
      </title>
      <p>
       We next studied a potential distant effect of the incorporated remdesivir-MP. To this end, we devised longer templates that allowed synthesis of a 14-mer full-length product (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f005">
        Figure 5
       </xref>
       ). To reduce the number of incorporation sites for the inhibitor, we also changed the sequence context in a systematic manner. Adenosine analogues can be incorporated in the following three blocks: (1) i, i+1; (2) i+3, i+4, i+5; and (3) i+7, i+8 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f005">
        Figure 5
       </xref>
       A). The control reaction in the presence of all four natural nucleotides yields the expected 14-mer full-length product. A faint band represents a longer 15-mer product that is likely generated in a template-independent manner. RNA synthesis in the absence of ATP and presence of remdesivir-TP is terminated at position i+5, which corresponds to a truncated 11-mer product. This result points to delayed chain termination as a potential mechanism of action. To assess whether delayed chain termination requires consecutive sites of inhibition, we devised templates that were mutated at position i+1, i+4, and at both i+1 and i+4, respectively. In each of these cases, we observed termination of RNA synthesis at position i+5 with only subtle differences in the overall patterns (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f005">
        Figure 5
       </xref>
       B–D). Hence, incorporation of remdesivir-MP at position i, i+3, and i+5 is sufficient to cause inhibition (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f005">
        Figure 5
       </xref>
       D). Consecutive sites of inhibitor incorporation are not required. Whether i+3 and i+5 are also necessary for inhibition could not be answered. We devised a template that contained only a single incorporation site at position i; however, overall RNA product formation is here decreased and prematurely terminated even in the absence of inhibitor (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f005">
        Figure 5
       </xref>
       E). A direct comparison of longer products generated in the absence and presence of inhibitor is therefore not possible. In general, it has been challenging to identify templates with a single uridine that gives rise to sufficient yields of the full-length product.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also studied whether delayed chain termination at position i+5 can be overcome with higher concentrations of the natural nucleotide substrate at position i+6 (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f006">
        Figure 6
       </xref>
       ). Dose–response experiments with concentrations of up to 1 mM of UTP show enhanced product formation in the presence of all nucleotides and absence of remdesivir-TP (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f006">
        Figure 6

        Figure 6

       We finally compared the inhibition pattern of remdesivir-TP with ara-ATP and 2′C-methyl-ATP (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00326-f007">

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-viruses-11-00326">
        33

        44

       , right panel) both yield the expected full-length 14-mer product in the presence of all four NTPs. In agreement with our previous study [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-viruses-11-00326">
        33
       </xref>
       ], ara-ATP is utilized as a substrate and causes chain termination with both enzymes. In contrast, 2′C-methyl-ATP is not utilized as a substrate. Neither EBOV RdRp nor RSV RdRp incorporates the inhibitor at relatively high concentrations of 100 μM. The data are consistent with previous modeling studies that point to a possible steric clash between the 2′C-methyl modification and residues near the active site of EBOV RdRp and RSV RdRp [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-viruses-11-00326">
        9
       </xref>
       ]. As discussed, remdesivir-MP is incorporated at position i and causes delayed chain termination at position i+5 with EBOV RdRp and RSV RdRp. Overall, the data demonstrate a specific pattern of inhibition with remdesivir-MP that is common to both polymerase complexes.

     <p>
      Remdesivir or GS-5734 is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of EVD [

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-viruses-11-00326">
       45
      </xref>
      ]. Preclinical studies have shown that remdesivir exhibits potent antiviral activity against multiple ebolavirus species [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-11-00326">
       10
      </xref>

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-viruses-11-00326">
       16
      </xref>
      ]. Increased intracellular levels of NTP pools correlated with increased antiviral activity, suggesting that the corresponding triphosphate is the active form of the inhibitor and the viral RdRp is the target [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-11-00326">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. Here we confirmed this assumption and demonstrated that remdesivir-TP is a substrate for the purified EBOV RdRp complex. Remdesivir-TP is an adenosine analog and therefore competes with ATP for incorporation. However, the incorporated inhibitor does not act as a chain terminator. Inhibition of RNA synthesis is seen predominantly at position i+5. Despite subtle sequence-dependent effects, RNA synthesis is commonly terminated at this point. Increasing the concentration of the next nucleotide does not overcome this effect. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that delayed chain termination is a major contributor to the antiviral activity of remdesivir.
     </p>
     <p>
      The broad spectrum of antiviral activities associated with remdesivir raises the question of whether delayed chain termination is a unifying mechanism of inhibition. Previous data have shown that the inhibitor is also incorporated by RSV RdRp [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-11-00326">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. The inhibitor caused premature termination before the full-length RNA product was formed. A similar result was obtained with the purified NiV RdRp complex and consecutive sites of incorporation seem to enhance this effect [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-viruses-11-00326">
       31
      </xref>
      ]. The collective data are in broad agreement with our study. Our enzyme kinetic evaluation revealed that the RSV RdRp enzyme, but not EBOV RdRp, pauses following incorporation of the inhibitor. Despite these differences, delayed chain termination is irreversible and therefore dominant. For both enzymes, the efficiency of incorporation of remdesivir-MP is only 4-fold (EBOV) and 3-fold (RSV) reduced when compared with its natural counterpart ATP. By comparison, a similar experimental approach revealed higher levels of discrimination when favipiravir-TP was studied with purified influenza A polymerase [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-viruses-11-00326">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. Favipiravir is incorporated opposite template C and template U. Discrimination against the inhibitor is here 19-fold (opposite C) and 30-fold (opposite U), respectively [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-viruses-11-00326">
       21
      </xref>
      ]. The high rate of incorporation of remdesivir likely contributes to the relatively low EC

       50

      values in cell-based assays. Remdesivir inhibits EBOV and RSV replication in cell-based assays with EC

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-11-00326">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. In contrast, human RNA Pol II and h-mtRNAP do not seem to be inhibited in the presence of remdesivir-TP [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-viruses-11-00326">
       10
      </xref>
      ]. We measured a ~500-fold reduction in efficiency of incorporation of remdesivir-MP over ATP with purified h-mtRNAP. Although potential other off-target effects may not be excluded, these data are consistent with low cytotoxicities in different cell types. For example, 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC

      In conclusion, this study provides evidence to show that delayed chain termination is a plausible mechanism of action of remdesivir against EBOV.

      ]. A prominent example is the mechanism of action of entecavir [

      ], which is approved for the treatment of infection with HBV. Seifer and colleagues reported that the HBV polymerase is inhibited at positions i+2 and i+3 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-viruses-11-00326">
       51
      </xref>
      ]. Entecavir was also shown to exhibit antiviral activity against HIV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53-viruses-11-00326">
       53
      </xref>
      ]. Our previous study with HIV-1 RT revealed that a major contributor to inhibition is delayed chain termination at position i+3 [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-viruses-11-00326">
       49
      </xref>
      ]. Footprinting experiments provided evidence to show that the enzyme is not adequately positioned to support binding of the next nucleotide. However, the structural reasons for such enzyme repositioning remain elusive. The inhibitory effect of remdesivir is even more distant, which suggests that delayed chain termination can be caused by different mechanisms. Unfavorable interactions between the incorporated inhibitor and distinct elements of the enzyme as well as structural alterations of the newly synthesized RNA must be considered in this regard. This study warrants further investigation into structures of EBOV, RSV, or NiV RdRp complexes and/or the modified double-stranded RNA to address these questions.

The presence of UTP and CTP provides a control for mis-incorporations. Incorporated ara-AMP acts as a chain terminator, 2′-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, and remdesivir-MP shows delayed chain termination at position i+5.

        GS-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that showed therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of Ebola virus infection. It has been administered under compassionate use to two Ebola patients, both of whom survived, and is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease. Here we report the antiviral activities of GS-5734 and the parent nucleoside analog across multiple virus families, providing evidence to support new indications for this compound against human viruses of significant public health concern.

      include zoonotic and human pathogens that are of significant public health concern, ranging from vaccine-preventable diseases such as Measles (MV) and Mumps (MuV) viruses to highly pathogenic viruses such as Nipah (NiV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola (EBOV) viruses, for which there are currently no approved therapeutics for human use. A broad spectrum therapeutic that can target multiple virus families would have a significant impact on disease burden in endemic areas. Nucleoside analogs are a class of small-molecule antivirals which can directly inhibit viral transcription and replication by targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and have been used as backbone components of combination therapies against both Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

      GS-5734 is a prodrug that is designed to deliver the nucleoside monophosphate into the cell, thereby circumventing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step and allowing for efficient formation of the active triphosphate species. Consistent with this notion, GS-5734 exhibited 10 to 100-fold higher antiviral potency relative to Nuc when tested against reporter and wild-type filo-, pneumo-, and paramyxoviruses, yielding EC

      To determine whether structural and sequence similarities of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) would provide additional insight into the observed antiviral spectrum, we took a hybrid approach that used both structural homology and primary protein sequence information to align the secondary structure of nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) from known crystal structures of various viral RdRps. Distinct ssRNA virus families do not necessarily share a common ancestor in the traditional phylogenetic sense, thus the primary sequence and structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) can be quite divergent. We therefore examined all available viral RdRP crystal structures and utilized secondary structure to align the nucleotide binding domains in iterative fashion by removing non-homologous regions. This resulted in a compelling structural alignment for the nucleotide binding domains, despite the overall structures of RdRPs being very different (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
       Fig. 1B
      </xref>
      ). For example, structural alignments of HCV against DenV (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
       Fig. 1C
      </xref>
      ) and VSV (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
       Fig. 1D
      </xref>
      ) RdRP nucleotide binding domains both show good overlap in the nucleotide binding regions, but have significant differences globally. This structural alignment informed the extraction of two 10-residue regions within motifs A and B that interact directly with the nucleotide

      (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">
       Fig. 1A
      </xref>
      ). Sequence similarity clustering analysis of these regions correlated with the observed spectrum of antiviral activity across virus families (
      <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">
       Fig. 2
      </xref>
      ). For instance we observe that while HCV and DenV are both inhibited by GS-5734 and have high sequence similarity among motifs A and B, VSV which is not inhibited by GS-5734 has low sequence similarity among motifs A and B when compared to HCV and other negative strand RNA viruses susceptible to GS-5734 inhibition. Taken together, our results expand the spectrum of viruses susceptible to Nuc and GS-5734, and further define their respective antiviral activities across 7 virus families. The unique potent broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 against paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses provides an opportunity to explore the compound for the treatment of highly pathogenic infections such as NiV and MERS-CoV in non-human primates, in addition to EBOV and other filoviruses. Depending on further careful assessment of its safety and efficacy profile, GS-5734 could also be considered for the treatment of prevalent respiratory infections (RSV, hPIV3, hMPV), as well as for controlling recurring outbreaks of MV globally among under-vaccinated populations.

HeLa cells (5,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and transfected with appropriate amounts of NiV support plasmids (N (50 ng/well), P (32 ng) and L (50 ng)), HeV minigenome (120 ng) and T7 polymerase (80 ng) prepared in RNase-free TE buffer, mixed with 0.8 μL/well LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) and 10 μL Opti-MEM/well. Complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before adding to cells. Compounds were added directly to the cells 4 h post-transfection. For negative controls, the L plasmid was substituted with an equivalent amount of pcDNA 3.1 plasmid expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry (Clontech). 48 h post-transfection of minigenome plasmids, 50 μL of Nanoluciferase assay buffer solution (Promega) was added directly to each well.

The average raw luminescence value for untreated non-transfected cells was set as 100% cell viability. Percent (%) cell viability for individual wells were calculated by dividing their respective raw luminescence values by the average raw luminescence value for non-transfected cells.

       Sequence similarity clustering analysis

      <p id="Par19">
       To estimate virus polymerase similarity, we took a hybrid approach that used both structural homology and primary protein sequence information. Distinct ssRNA virus families do not necessarily share a common ancestor in the traditional phylogenetic sense, thus the primary sequence and structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) can be quite divergent. We therefore examined all available viral RdRP crystal structures and utilized secondary structure to align the nucleotide binding domains in iterative fashion by removing non-homologous regions. This resulted in a compelling structural alignment for the nucleotide binding domains (
       <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM64">
        Supplementary Figure 12
       </xref>
       ), although the overall structures of RdRPs were quite divergent. This allowed us to determine functionally homologous nucleotide binding residues (motifs A and B)

       . We extracted the primary amino acid sequences (10 residues each) and aligned them by homology to viral RdRPs without known crystal structures using the global-local pairwise alignment in the Biostrings package in R. Grouping of these sequences was determined by calculating a distance matrix followed by hierarchical linkage clustering. The distance matrix was estimated by taking the negative values of Smith-Waterman alignments (gap open penalty of −5, extension penalty of −1, and match/mismatch values derived from BLOSUM62). Clustering was performed using hclust in R. Results were comparable to those derived from multiple sequence alignments on the extracted regions using MUSCLE

M.K.L., P.R., M.F., and L.K.M. propagated and quantitated stocks of viruses used in the study. A.A. and J.S. performed structural polymerase alignments and similarity clustering analyses. P.R., A.L.H., M.F., and L.K.M. assisted in executing cell-based infection assays. R.L.M., D.S., H.C.H., A.S.R., and M.O.C. were responsible for the synthesis, characterization, and scale-up of small molecules. M.K.L., R.J., M.P., T.C., S.T.N., and C.F.S. designed experiments, provided project oversight, evaluated results, and outlined and wrote the manuscript.

        The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which was unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae

        . No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734

         in vitro

        , and the NTP acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life, 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg

        </sup>
        GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734

         in vitro
        </italic>
        against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.

The mechanism of action of Nuc requires intracellular anabolism to the active triphosphate metabolite (NTP), which is expected to interfere with the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RdRp). Structurally, the 1′-cyano group provides potency and selectivity towards viral RNA polymerases, but because of slow first phosphorylation kinetics, modification of parent nucleosides with monophosphate promoieties has the potential to greatly enhance intracellular NTP concentrations

Taken together, the pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that once-daily dosing of GS-5734 provides sustained intracellular NTP levels and efficiently delivers drug metabolites to sanctuary sites where virus may persist.

      In summary, GS-5734 is a potent and selective inhibitor of EBOV in multiple relevant permissive cell types. In healthy NHPs, intravenous administration of GS-5734 resulted in rapid accumulation and persistence of intracellular NTP. In an NHP model of fatal EVD, pronounced antiviral effects, amelioration of EVD signs, and significant survival benefit was achieved despite treatment initiation on day 3, a time when systemic viral RNA was detectable. These results represent the first case of substantive post-exposure protection against EVD by a small-molecule antiviral compound in NHPs. Intravenous GS-5734 is currently being evaluated in multiple-dose studies in healthy human volunteers to assess clinical safety and pharmacokinetics, and help determine whether GS-5734 may provide therapeutic benefit in acute or recrudescent cases of EVD, or in survivors with prolonged virus shedding and/or chronic clinical sequelae. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 and its amenability to large-scale production warrants further assessment of its therapeutic potential against other human viral pathogens for which no treatment is available.

       No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size for biochemical or cell-based assays, or for pharmacokinetic studies. Investigators were not blinded to outcome assessment during these investigations. For GS-5734 efficacy assessments in nonhuman primates, statistical power analysis was used to predetermine sample size, and subjects were randomly assigned to experimental group, stratified by sex and balanced by body weight. Study personnel responsible for assessing animal health (including euthanasia assessment) and administering treatments were experimentally blinded to group assignment of animals and outcome.

       Antiviral assays were conducted in biosafety level 4 containment (BSL-4) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. EBOV antiviral assays were conducted in primary HMVEC-TERT and in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were not authenticated and were not tested for mycoplasma. Ten concentrations of compound were diluted in fourfold serial dilution increments in media, and 100 μl per well of each dilution was transferred in duplicate (Huh-7) or quadruplicate (HMVEC-TERT) onto 96-well assay plates containing cell monolayers. The plates were transferred to BSL-4 containment, and the appropriate dilution of virus stock was added to test plates containing cells and serially diluted compounds. Each plate included four wells of infected untreated cells and four wells of uninfected cells that served as 0% and 100% virus inhibition controls, respectively. After the infection, assay plates were incubated for 3 days (Huh-7) or 5 days (HMVEC-TERT) in a tissue culture incubator. Virus replication was measured by direct fluorescence using a Biotek HTSynergy plate reader. For virus yield assays, Huh-7 cells were infected with wild-type EBOV for 1 h at 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell. The virus inoculum was removed and replaced with 100 μl per well of media containing the appropriate dilution of compound. At 3 days post-infection, supernatants were collected, and the amount of virus was quantified by endpoint dilution assay. The endpoint dilution assay was conducted by preparing serial dilutions of the assay media and adding these dilutions to fresh Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates to determine the tissue culture infectious dose that caused 50% cytopathic effects (TCID

       . The primary antibody specific for a particular viral protein was diluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer (1 × PBS with 3% BSA) and added to each well of the assay plate. The assay plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 × PBS. The secondary detection antibody was an anti-mouse (or rabbit) IgG conjugated with Dylight488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue number 405310). The secondary antibody was diluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer and was added to each well in the assay plate. Assay plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Draq5 (Biostatus) or 33342 Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific) for Vero and HFF-1 cell lines. Both dyes were diluted in 1× PBS. The cytoplasm of HFF-1 (EBOV assay) and Vero E6 (MERS assay) cells were counter-stained with CellMask Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell images were acquired using a Perkin Elmer Opera confocal plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a ×10 air objective to collect five images per well. Virus-specific antigen was quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 488 nm wavelength and the stained nuclei were quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 640 nm wavelength. Acquired images were analysed using Harmony and Acapella PE software. The Draq5 signal was used to generate a nuclei mask to define each nuclei in the image for quantification of cell number. The CellMask Deep Red dye was used to demarcate the Vero and HFF-1 cell borders for cell-number quantitation. The viral-antigen signal was compartmentalized within the cell mask. Cells that exhibited antigen signal higher than the selected threshold were counted as positive for viral infection. The ratio of virus-positive cells to total number of analysed cells was used to determine the percentage of infection for each well on the assay plates. The effect of compounds on the viral infection was assessed as percentage of inhibition of infection in comparison to control wells. The resultant cell number and percentage of infection were normalized for each assay plate. Analysis of dose–response curve was performed using GeneData Screener software applying Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for curve-fitting strategy. The curve-fitting process, including individual data point exclusion, was pre-specified by default software settings.

       = 6 animals total) was used as control group in all statistical comparisons of GS-5734 efficacy evaluations. The impact of GS-5734 treatment on the survival rates was estimated using Kaplan–Meier method and analysed by log-rank analysis using Dunnett–Hsu procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons. The effect on systemic viral RNA levels was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparing each GS-5734 treatment group with vehicle group using Dunnett’s test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Wilcoxon rank-sum test without adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to compare the effects of GS-5734 treatment on haematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters. All data met the statistical assumptions of the test performed.

Transient exposure to the intermediate alanine metabolite (Ala-Met) is observed, followed by persistent Nuc exposure. The pharmacologically active NTP is formed quickly, achieving a maximum intracellular concentration at 4 h and persisted with a half-life of 16 ± 1 h in the three donors. Intracellular concentration was estimated on the basis of an intracellular volume of 1 pl per cell.

            Animals were observed multiple times each day and were subjectively assigned a clinical disease score ranging from 0 to 5 based on responsiveness, posture, and activity. Maximum daily scores were converted to colour code, with darker colours indicative of more severe disease signs. The schematic was truncated to emphasize clinical scores during the acute disease phase, and none of the animals exhibited clinical disease signs outside of the times that are shown.

        The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for antivirals. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.

     <p id="p0035">
      The recent emergence of a new SARS-like coronavirus in December 2019 (now named SARS-CoV-2) likely from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan China, is the cause of significant global health concern. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be closest related (∼88%) to two bat-derived SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), with ∼79% overall sequence identity to SARS-CoV and ∼50% to MERS-CoV. At the present time, any mention of the number of cases, affected countries, and case/fatality ratio will be outdated at print time.

      To date, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic options are available for the control or treatment of any human CoV. Recent compassionate clinical trials of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as well as Remdesivir (see below) have been conducted, and await publication in scientific journals. The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 outlines the importance of and immediate need for antivirals. Potential broad-spectrum targets include viral gene products that are widely conserved and do not exist in the host cell, or that are structurally and functionally different enough from cellular homologous to achieve selective inhibition. For RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an optimal target due to its crucial role in RNA synthesis, lack of host homolog and high sequence and structural conservation. The RdRp remains the target of choice for the treatment of several viral diseases, including chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus infection. Arguably the most promising, broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Upon delivery into the host cell, nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs are metabolized into an active 5'-triphosphate form (5'-TP) which competes with endogenous nucleotides as substrates for the viral RdRp. The NAs are subsequently incorporated into the nascent viral RNA by the RdRp, accounting for the antiviral effect through several mechanisms of action (MoA).

      A second MoA exists without termination or slow-down of RNA synthesis, but rather through high level incorporation of NA-TPs throughout the nascent RNA. These NAs are unable to be recognized as 'regular' Watson-Crick nucleobases during subsequent rounds of RNA synthesis from the NA-containing template. This results in an increase in mutations and ultimately leads to non-viable genomes, a process known as ‘lethal mutagenesis’

      Despite this, NAs remain a good option for the treatment of CoV infections based on the high level of structural conservation of the viral RdRps, particularly regarding nucleotide binding sites. Additionally, NAs display a relatively high barrier to resistance relative to other antivirals, as escape mutations likely come at a high cost to viral replication. In support of this, the broad-spectrum AMP analogue Remdesivir (GS-5734) which is currently used for the treatment of several diverse viral infections has shown promising results, inhibiting viral replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in various

Passage of wild-type (WT) MHV with the Remdesivir (GS-5734) and/or parent nucleoside GS-441524 resulted in phenotypic resistance associated with two nonsynonymous mutations in the predicted fingers subdomain of the nsp12 RdRp (F480L and V557L SARS-CoV numbering). Given the potential of NAs as broad-spectrum antivirals for the treatment of CoV infections, it is imperative to understand the structural and functional implications of these mutations.

       Neither of the resistance mutations directly impact the catalytic site nor substrate-binding pocket, but rather cause minor structural alterations which likely impact an NTP ‘checking step’ performed by the polymerase before catalysis (

       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">

       C). The phenyl ring is orientated towards hydrophobic residues from the palm (V637, L638) and the fingers (I579, V693), and plays a structural role in tightening the two domains by a strong mesh of hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, residue V557 is located at the end of motif F on the second strand forming the side of the RNA template entry channel (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">

       , it can be predicted that the valine side chain faces the template RNA and interacts with the base to be paired with the incoming NTP. F480 is completely buried while V557 is partially exposed to solvent with solvent accessibility of 4.2 and 35.2 % respectively. Nevertheless, the server of protein thermodynamic stability changes upon single-site mutations

       and predicts for both mutations a slight increase in Free energy (ΔG) of the protein, corresponding to a structural relaxation.
      </p>
      <p id="p0115">
       The conserved F480L mutation reduces the amount of interactions within the hydrophobic core, thereby retaining the overall conformation while lowering the structural rigidity. The resulting increase of free energy should allow a greater degree of freedom of the secondary structure elements which harbors those hydrophobic residues. In related viral RdRps, the serine of motif B is thought to be responsible for allowing the proper positioning of the ribose moiety of the incoming NTP via the establishment of a hydrogen bond network with the 2’ OH group of the ribose (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">
        Fig. 3

       Valine 557 is also located in the vicinity of motif B (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">
        Fig 3
       </xref>
       A and C). The consequence of a valine to leucine mutation is an extended hydrophobic side chain, generating a steric hindrance with the template RNA. As a result, it is expected that the RNA would be deviated from the grove away from the serine of motif B. Again, it is possible to hypothesize that this deviation would alter the serine fidelity check, allowing easier incorporation of ATP relative to GS 441524-TP thus resulting in discrimination against the latter. Again, validation of this hypothesis requires detailed kinetics investigating nucleotide incorporation at the nsp12 active site.

       It is interesting to note that the nucleotide at the 3'-end shows some possible room at its 1'-position, hinting that GS 441524-TP, once incorporated, could potentially translocate (

It is thus likely that excision of GS 441524-MP is significantly less efficient than that of a regular nucleotide.

      As proven by the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the emergence of new, significant human pathogens from zoonotic CoVs is a threat, and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals remains a priority. The RdRp domain remains an extremely attractive target for antivirals due to the high level of structural-conservation across diverse RNA viruses; denoting the potential for broad-spectrum applicability coupled with the advantage of having a relatively high barrier for resistance mutations. NAs constitute an attractive option, with success against several diverse RNA viruses. Nevertheless, CoVs are a particularly challenging case due to the additional presence of a unique exonuclease activity in their nsp14 gene product, which confers resistance to several commonly used NAs including Rbv via an error correcting mechanism.

      . However, unlike other Rbv and 5-FU, Remdesivir is active on WT, and ExoN(-) mutants show only modest 4.5 fold increase in sensitivity to Remdesivir, indicating that inhibition likely originates by a mixed effect balanced between incorporation and excision.
     </p>
     <p id="p0170">
      The increased efficiency of Remdesivir relative to other NAs indicates that its metabolite GS 441524-TP must be incorporated by the polymerase at a level superior to that of the excision rate of the GS 441524-MP by the ExoN, and/or be less accessible or removed less-efficiently by the ExoN. In contrast, while Rbv-TP also appears to be efficiently incorporated into the nascent RNA by the RdRp, it is likely to be excised just as efficiently by the ExoN.
     </p>
     <p id="p0175">
      CoV RdRps are able to accommodate a wide variety of different chemical modifications of NAs (e.g., on the ribose, on the base, on both)

      . The ability of the ExoN domain to recognise these diverse modifications should therefore be taken into consideration, and represents a potential avenue which could be exploited for NA drug development. Studies which analyse the difference in recognition, incorporation of GS 441524 5’-TP and excision of GS 441524-MP compared to other NA-TPs by the CoV RdRp, ExoN and other replication machinery will provide crucial insights into proper design of novel NAs.

        An escalating pandemic by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed. We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients. We report the antiviral effect of remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 μM, 26.63 μM, 2.55 μM and 0.46 μM, respectively. Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM. Synergy between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 μM in combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield. Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.

     Within three months of the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the world is facing an escalating pandemic that will have significant impacts on global health systems and economy (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">
      WHO, 2019
     </xref>
     ). Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus may lead to a wide range of clinical presentations from asymptomatic infection in 1% of laboratory confirmed cases to mild, severe, and critical infections in 81%, 14%, and 5% of symptomatic cases, respectively (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">
      Wu and McGoogan, 2020
     </xref>
     ). The estimated symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR) among cases in Wuhan was 1.4%, and those aged above 59 were 5.1 times more likely to die from infection than those aged 30–59 years (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">
      Wu et al., 2020
     </xref>
     ). With an estimated basic reproductive number of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4–3.9) (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">
      Li et al., 2020
     </xref>
     ), the virus will continue to spread and infect 55% of the global population over time if no effective vaccine is developed (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">
      Fine et al., 2011

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">
      Wang et al., 2020
     </xref>
     ). According to the 7th edition of the novel coronavirus diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, options for antiviral therapy include aerosolized α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, or Arbidol (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
      China National Health Commission, 2020
     </xref>
     ). Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir, and various HIV-protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, ASC09/ritonavir, darunavir), reverse transcriptase inhibitor (Azvudine), anti-influenza compounds, interferon alfa-2b, or monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 (Camrelizumab) or IL-6 (Tocilizumab) (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">
      Chinese Clinical Trial Re

     ). We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of compounds that have been under development or already approved for other clinical applications; some compounds were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication in vitro, and some are evaluated in clinical trials in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Compounds were sourced from MedChemExpress and Sigma-Aldrich and the stocks were prepared with DMSO (50 mM remdesivir, 100 mM favipiravir, 10 mM R-1479, 10 mM tenofovir, 10 mM fludarabine phosphate, 10 mM baloxavir, 10 mM chlorpromazine hydrochloride, 5 mM dalbavancin hydrochloride, 10 mM homoharringtonine, 10 mM lopinavir, 10 mM ritonavir) or with water (5 mM emetine dihydrochloride, 10 mM galidesivir hydrochloride, 50 mM ribavirin, 2.5 mM oritavancin diphosphate). Oseltamivir carboxylate (10 mM in water) was provided by Roche. To evaluate the effect of compounds in vitro, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with compounds diluted in infection media for 1 h prior to infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI = 0.02. Antiviral compounds were maintained with the virus inoculum during the 2-h incubation period. The inoculum was removed after incubation, and the cells were overlaid with infection media containing diluted compounds. After 48 h incubation at 37 °C, supernatants were collected to quantify viral loads by TCID

     under 100 μM (
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">

     ). Importantly, we observed that some of the compounds currently undergoing clinical trials such as ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, or baloxavir showed no apparent antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro at concentrations under 100 μM (
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">
      Table 1

     ). Remdesivir is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine analogue that has been shown to inhibit human coronaviruses (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E) SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (

     ). Two mutations (F476L and V553L) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 of a murine hepatitis virus have been previously reported to confer resistance to remdesivir (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
      Agostini et al., 2018
     </xref>
     ). Due to insertions and deletions in nsp12, these two conserved residues are mapped at F480 and V557 in the SARS-CoV-2 isolate (GISAID# EPI_ISL_412028) used for the experiments, which should remain sensitive for remdesivir. Other adenosine analogues (galidesivir, tenofovor, or fludarabine phosphate) or nucleoside analogues (favipiravir, ribavirin, R-1479) did not inhibit viral replication under 100 μM (
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">
      Table 1
     </xref>
     ). However, nucleoside analogues require metabolic activation into their triphosphate forms by host cellular nucleoside kinases, which may differ among cell types. Further evaluation of the effect of nucleoside analogues in primary human airway epithelial cells would facilitate the interpretation of the results.

     Lopinavir in combination with ritonavir are FDA approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Lopinavir was more potent in inhibiting HIV-1 than ritonavir in vitro but showed poor bioavailability in vivo. Ritonavir inhibits not only HIV-1 protease but also the host's cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme that metabolizes lopinavir (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">
      Kempf et al., 1997

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">
      Sham et al., 1998

     ). Lopinavir but not ritonavir showed antiviral effect against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E in vitro, with mean EC

     ranged from 6.6 to 17.1 μM (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">
      de Wilde et al., 2014
     </xref>
     ). Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin were used previously to treat SARS-CoV patients under a non-randomized clinical trial. Less SARS patients developed into ARDS or death after receiving the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin than historical controls who received ribavirin and corticosteroids (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
      Chu et al., 2004
     </xref>
     ). Efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin is currently evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 patients under randomized control trials. In agreement with previous reports, we observed antiviral effect of lopinavir (EC
     <sub>

     at 26.1 μM) but not ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (

     B and
     <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">

     ). HIV-1 patients treated with 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 9.4 μM (IQR 7.2–12.1 μM), which is below the EC

     against SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">
      Lopez-Cortes et al., 2013
     </xref>
     ). Currently, lopinavir/ritonavir at 400mg/100 mg twice daily with or without ribavirin are part of the recommended treatment for managing COVID-19 patients in China (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
      China National Health Commission, 2020
     </xref>
     ). A recent randomized control trial reported no significant benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients than standard care, as the time to clinical improvement, mortality at 28 days, and viral loads at various time points were comparable between the two groups (
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">
      Cao et al., 2020

     ). Combinational therapy of lopinavir with the other effective compounds against SARS-CoV-2 virus may increase synergy and reduce the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir.

     To reduce the effective concentration of individual compound below the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration, we explored the combinational effect of remdesivir and emetine in vitro. Drug interaction was evaluated using the checkerboard assay with serially 2-fold diluted remdesivir (0–50 μM) and emetine (0–0.781 μM) in combination. Remdesivir at 6.25 μM in combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition of viral yield, which can be further tested in vivo (

     We confirm the antiviral activity of four compounds that have been reported to inhibit other coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Our results suggest that combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration against SARS-CoV-2 under the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration. There is an urgent research need to identify optimal dose combination of effective compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 virus for better clinical benefit.

        The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with &gt;99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

      ). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Regarding the virus itself, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

      . It is essential to limit human-to-human transmission in order to reduce secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers and to prevent transmission amplification events and further international spread from China. Based on previous experience of management of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO recommend infection control interventions to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment, and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Moreover, people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette, which is to maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands, and within healthcare facilities enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices are recommended in hospitals, especially in emergency departments

Finally, although the improvement of internet communication largely enhances the availability and dissemination of knowledge, the internet also has the potential for the development and spread of misinformation or fake news.

      Unresolved issues

     <p id="para0017">
      Despite the whole world's efforts to understand COVID-19, many issues remain unclear. First, one report has demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stools
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0007">
       [7]
      </xref>
      . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the faecal–oral route remains unclear. Second, previous studies showed that SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses could survive on environmental surfaces and inanimate objects

      ; however, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment has not been reported. Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses could be efficiently inactivated using surface disinfectants with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min, but other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate were less effective

       [45]
      </xref>
      . However, current investigation of the efficacy of commonly used disinfection agents against SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Third, although travel restriction was exerted in many countries, whether this intervention was effective is unclear. Fourth, although one case responded well to remdesivir
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0007">

      . The article reported that only 43.8% of patients had a initial presentation of fever, and severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7% of cases. The study indicated the median incubation period to be 3.0 days (range, 0–24.0 days) and the fatality rate to be only 1.36%

      . However, further evaluation of the content of the above report is warranted to clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic carriers and of ARD and pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, although 32.4% (

      , a study on the temporal features of the SARS-CoV-2‐induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions is lacking. Previous experiences of systemic steroids in the treatment of coronavirus-related infections, such as SARS and MERS, showed disappointing results. In the interim, clinical use of glucocorticoids to control SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with the intention of regulating cytokine production and the inflammatory response and avoiding lung injury should be avoided

     <p id="para0018">
      The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers worldwide. However, knowledge about this novel virus remains limited. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. What we can do now is aggressively implement infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via human-to-human transmission. Public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation, as the more we learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreaks, the better we can respond.

The disease spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so-called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was known to be diverse in severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to mild respiratory tract infection and severe or fatal pneumonia. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted within the family, in the community, among cruise passengers and in hospitals, and has become a public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020. As of 28 February 2020, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 56 countries and territories with more than 83 382 cases reported globally; more than 78 832 of these cases were reported from China (

      Even before approval and clinical use, the concern of antiviral resistance against remdesivir has been studied. Using MHV as the tested coronavirus, two of three lineages of wild-type MHV in the presence of increased concentrations of GS-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages, and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant, conferring a 5.6-fold increase in the EC

      <sub>
       50
      </sub>
      in SARS-CoV. However, the remdesivir-resistant MHV with F476L and V553L mutations was outcompeted by wild-type MHV in the absence of GS-5734, suggestive of the effect of remdesivir resistance on decreased viral fitness. Of note, in the mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV-infected mice lost less weight and had a more evident decline in pulmonary viral loads by 4 days after infection than wild-type SARS-CoV-infected mice, indicative of attenuated pathogenicity of remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV. The above findings indicate a high genetic barrier for remdesivir to develop resistance a well as decreased fitness and pathogenicity in remdesivir-resistant mutants, and further encourage the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the treatment of newly emerging COVID-19.

      With the favourable in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir, it has been further tested in animal models of different viral infections. In a rhesus monkey model of Ebola virus disease, daily administration of 10 mg/kg remdesivir for 12 days profoundly suppressed the replication of Ebola virus and protected all infected animals against this lethal infection

      , and such data may be valuable in the same animal species with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although in the animal study the plasma half-life of remdesivir was short (0.39 h), remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs, converted into its active form within 2 h post-infusion, and had an intracellular half-life of 14 h. In the absence of any human pharmacokinetic information, such data from rhesus monkeys indicate that parenteral daily dosing of remdesivir may achieve sustained intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphate, which are above its EC

Although remdesivir therapy was not favoured due to the high mortality rate of 53.1% (93/175), no detailed clinical or biochemical side effects associated with remdesivir therapy was ever described; the safety profile of remdesivir was not challenged. One patient on remdesivir therapy developed hypotension and cardiac arrest after discontinuation of the loading dose; however, the authors explained that such an adverse event cannot be excluded to be related to underlying Ebola virus disease, a potentially fatal infectious disease.

Of note, real-time reverse transcription PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs remained positive at 4 days after the administration of remdesivir, but the authors noted a trend in the decline of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs [cycle threshold values: illness Day 7 (the day of remdesivir administration), 23–24; Day 11, 33–34; and Day 12, 37–40]. The oropharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 one day later.

     <p id="para0015">
      With an effective reduction of pulmonary viral load in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection, potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, acceptable safety profile of parenteral remdesivir therapy in two case reports, and a randomised trial of Ebola virus disease, the clinical use of remdesivir in the cases of COVID-19 is are highly anticipated. Two randomised clinical trials of parenteral remdesivir therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 in China may open the window for effective antiviral therapy for such an epidemic infectious disease.

        SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further

      Coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) broke out and spread to five continents in 2003 with a lethal rate of 10%

      . To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Therefore, CoVs are considered to be a kind of viruses, of which the outbreak poses a huge threat to humans. Because Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019, the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or “2019-nCoV” by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020

      . Since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous with SARS-CoV, it is considered a close relative of SARS-CoV. The International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. At the same time, WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as COVID-19. Common symptoms of a person infected with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2

      Potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target, one is acting on the human immune system or human cells, and the other is on coronavirus itself. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response

      . Blocking the signal pathways of human cells required for virus replication may show a certain anti-viral effect. In addition, viruses often bind to receptor proteins on the surface of cells in order to entering human cells, for example, the SARS virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor

      . The therapies acting on the coronavirus itself include preventing the synthesis of viral RNA through acting on the genetic material of the virus, inhibiting virus replication through acting on critical enzymes of virus, and blocking the virus binding to human cell receptors or inhibiting the virus’s self-assembly process through acting on some structural proteins.

      In the fight against coronavirus, scientists have come up with three strategies for developing new drugs

      . Interferons, ribavirin, and cyclophilin inhibitors used to treat coronavirus pneumonia fall into this category. The advantages of these therapies are that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating viral infections. But the disadvantage is that these therapies are too “broad-spectrum” and cannot kill coronaviruses in a targeted manner, and their side effects should not be underestimated.

      is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.

      For the development of medicines treating SARS-CoV-2, the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs. Once the efficacy is determined, it can be approved by the Green Channel or approved by the hospital ethics committee for rapid clinical treatment of patients. Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc. Further, we used these proteins and human relative proteins [human ACE2 and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) enzymes] as targets to screen ZINC U. S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug database (ZINC drug database, ZDD), our own database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products (including reported common anti-viral components from traditional Chinese medicine), and the database of commonly used anti-viral drugs (78 compounds) by virtual ligand screening method. This study predicts a variety of compounds that may inhibit novel coronaviruses and provides scientists with information on compounds that may be effective. Subsequent validation of anti-viral effects

       Analysis, structure prediction and homology modeling of SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins

       We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Gene Bank. The genome sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 was aligned with whole database using BLASTn to search for homology viral genomes. After phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of 23 coronaviruses from various species. We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (

       B, Bat-Cov RaTG13 exhibited the closest linkage with SARS-CoV-2. These phylogenetic evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be evolved from bat CoVs, especially RaTG13. Among all coronaviruses from human, SARS-CoV (80%) exhibited the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. And MERS/isolate NL13845 also has 50% identity with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV is the most clearly studied one among all these viruses according to previous literatures. Structure and function of its most genome encoded proteins have been elucidated in recent years. In this study, because of high genome identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the structure and function prediction of SARS-CoV-2 genome encoded protein were mainly based on those researches on homology protein in SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 genome has 10 open reading frames (

ORF2-10 encodes viral structural proteins such as S, M, N, and E proteins, and other auxiliary proteins. The S, M, E proteins are involved in the formation of the viral coat, and the N protein is involved in the packaging of the RNA genome (

Among them, Nsp3 contains multiple domains, including a segment of SARS unique domain and a deubiquitination and proteolytic enzyme PLpro. Nsp5 is 3CLpro, Nsp12 is an RdRp, and Nsp13 is helicase. As a new coronavirus, structure biology study about these proteins still at early stage. Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).

        Targets preventing the virus RNA synthesis and replication
       </title>
       <p id="p0090">
        As significant functional proteins of coronavirus, Nsps are involved in RNA transcription, translation, protein synthesis, processing and modification, virus replication and infection of the host. Among them, 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp and helicase are the most important targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors due to their clear biological functions and vital enzyme active site.

        <p id="p0095">
         PLpro is responsible for the cleavages of N-terminus of the replicase poly-protein to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3, which is essential for correcting virus replication

         . As an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host, PLpro has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors. It is very valuable for targeting PLpro to treat coronavirus infections, but no inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for marketing.

       In order to further verify the screening results of ZINC drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately, we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation, including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. The compounds were docked with 19 constructed targets of SARS-CoV-2 and 2 human targets to predict their possible targets, and also to search possible binding partners of certain important targets. Special attentions were paid to the drugs currently in clinical trials. All results of calculated docking scores were listed in the Supporting excel file (anti-virals_vs_targets_scores), significant scores (score&lt;–32, mfScore&lt;–110) were highlighted in brighten yellow.

      Discussion

     <p id="p0250">
      The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current options for treating life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections are very limited. Although the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012 triggered extensive research efforts, there are currently no drugs that can treat any zoonotic coronavirus. The transient nature of this epidemic is one of the major reasons why no prototype coronavirus inhibitor has progressed to the (early) preclinical stage to date. As with the SARS virus 17 years ago and the current SARS-CoV-2, emerging coronaviruses in the future may continue to pose a threat to global public health. Therefore, finding broad-spectrum inhibitors that may reduce the effects of human coronavirus infection remains a challenging research focus. Given the time-consuming nature of anti-viral drug development and registration, existing treatments for other diseases may be the only fastest treatment option for emerging infectious diseases. For most of these drugs that have been prepared, the medication has sufficient experience and dosage, and their safety and ADME situation are well known.

      From protein–protein docking results, we can deduce that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein have strong binding affinity to human ACE2, although weaker than that of SARS-CoV Spike protein. Unexpectedly, Bat-CoV RaTG13 Spike protein only has slightly weaker binding affinity with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2. It is speculated that the virus may be capable of infecting humans directly, or it is close. If SARS-CoV-2 evolved from Bat-CoV RaTG13, there may be no more than one or two host evolutions involved. But there are no published articles that directly related to intermediate hosts yet. According to the most recent research paper on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection

      . However, the fast growing incidents of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and related deaths implied the weaker binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with human ACE2 compared to SARS Spike may not fully explained the current situation of this epidemic. There must have some other receptors of SARS-CoV-2 or infection facilitating mechanisms in the human host, or SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may take other lower energy binding conformation different from current SARS-CoV Spike-RBD conformation found in the crystal structure, probably by induce fitting. These need to be further investigated.

      Also, we dock existing anti-viral drugs with our targets, analyze the possible targets of each anti-viral drug horizontally, and analyze the drugs that may interact with 21 targets vertically. We analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp, helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs. The three targets Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel are screened more anti-viral drugs. This may be due to the model problem because of flexible small protein (Nsp3b and Nsp3c) or partial model (E-channel). Whether the screened anti-viral drugs really work on these targets needs further verification. We also do not recommend the application of new coronavirus pneumonia to compounds for which no target has been predicted.

      In response to the recently reported anti-AIDS drugs lopinavir and ritonavir tablets, which have a poor effect on the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and have toxic side effects, we analyzed it in conjunction with the docking results. The molecular docking results show that ritonavir’s possible target is Nsp3c or E-channel. Lopinavir’s possible target is Nsp3b, Nsp3c, helicase, NRBD or E-channel. Some of these targets (such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, E-channel) may be false positives due to the model inaccuracy for small flexible protein or partial model. For both lopinavir and ritonavir, we did not observe possible binding to major targets like 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and so on. This docking result implies lopinavir and ritonavir tablets may not be suitable for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

       <p>
        Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe resulting in a pandemic. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 200 000 patients and associated with over 8000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization).

        On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options. It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation.

     In December 2019, several patients in Wuhan, Hubei, China were diagnosed with pneumonia secondary to an unknown virus. In response, an epidemiological alert was placed with the World Health Organization (WHO) dated December 31, 2019. By January 7, 2020 Chinese scientists had isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">

     </xref>
     ]. In the months that followed, SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread across the globe resulting in the current pandemic. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 245 000 patients and associated with over 10 000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], WHO).

     On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 19, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options. It is important to caution readers that new data emerges approximately every hour regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation. Most existing preclinical and clinical data on antiviral therapy are derived from other viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 (first reported in 2003), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ([MERS-CoV] first reported in 2012), and non-coronaviruses (eg, Ebola virus disease). It is unclear how well these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of antiviral in vitro activity (defined as half-maximal effective concentration [EC
     <sub>
      50
     </sub>
     ] values) remains unclear given an absence of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic or clinical data that equates achievable exposures relative to these values to a treatment effect. Finally, in vitro data should be compared cautiously across studies given the potential variability in testing methodologies that could impact perceived activity.

       Remdesivir
      </title>
      <p>
       Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an investigational monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog that was developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. In its active triphosphate nucleoside form, remdesivir binds to ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase and acts as an RNA-chain terminator. It displays potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       at 48 hours of 0.77 µM in Vero E6 cells [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
        3
       </xref>
       ]. Similar activity has been demonstrated against other zoonotic coronaviruses with EC

       values of 0.07 µM demonstrated for both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
        3–6
       </xref>
       ]. Remdesivir is highly selective for viral polymerases and is therefore expected to have a low propensity to cause human toxicity. Accordingly, Sheahan et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">
        6
       </xref>
       ] demonstrated a wide therapeutic index for remdesivir in a human airway epithelial cell model. The drug also displays a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and has a long intracellular half-life that allows for once-daily dosing [

       The therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir was first described in an animal model against Ebola among infected rhesus monkeys in which once-daily dosing resulted in suppression of viral replication and protection from lethal disease [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">
        9
       </xref>
       ]. However, in a human study, remdesivir-treated patients with Ebola experienced a 28-day mortality rate of 53% in a randomized controlled trial of 4 experimental therapies conducted in response to the Democratic Republic of Congo outbreak of 2018, resulting in early termination of this study arm [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">
        10
       </xref>
       ]. It is worth noting that this trial did not have an active control arm, and mortality rates for the other experimental treatments were 49.7% (ZMapp), 35.1% (Mab114), and 33.5% (REGN-EB3). Against MERS-CoV, Sheahan et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">
        5
       </xref>
       ] evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir among infected mice and found treatment significantly reduced virus lung titers, weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and lung injury scores. The authors proposed the importance of early therapy initiation to diminish virus replication and promote pulmonary repair because remdesivir demonstrated less clinical benefit with high-titer virus inoculum. Most notably, the authors also noted that prophylactic remdesivir diminished MERS-CoV replication and disease, which was similar to their findings in a murine model with SARS-CoV-1 [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">
        5

       ,

       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       The first report of a remdesivir-treated patient with COVID-19 in the United States was a 35-year-old male in Snohomish County, Washington who received treatment on hospital day 7 (illness day 11) due to developing pneumonia and persistent fevers [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">
        11
       </xref>
       ]. The patient experienced clinical improvement and negativity of oropharyngeal swab on hospital day 8, although nasopharyngeal swab remained positive. No adverse events to remdesivir were reported for the patient, which is consistent with previous case reports of use in other viruses [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">
        12
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">
        13
       </xref>
       ]. Among the first 12 patients confirmed by the CDC to have COVID-19 in the United States, 3 were treated with remdesivir via compassionate use protocol [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">
        14
       </xref>
       ]. All patients reported transient gastrointestinal symptoms and aminotransferase elevation. All patients are reportedly recovering, but the authors were unable to assess the efficacy or safety of remdesivir based on the lack of comparator and confounding treatments, including concomitant use of corticosteroids in one patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 4 clinical trials currently enrolling patients in the United States (
       <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">
        Table 1
       </xref>
       ). Two additional trials recruiting only in China have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04257656 (severe disease) and NCT04252664 (mild/moderate disease). Remdesivir may also be obtained through compassionate use and the emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) application process. At the time of this review, requests for compassionate use must be submitted online via
       <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdvcu.gilead.com/">
        https://rdvcu.gilead.com/
       </ext-link>
       . Compassionate use is only considered for hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 requiring mechanical ventilation in whom enrollment in a clinical trial is not feasible. Patients are excluded from the compassionate use program if they do not meet the above criteria, have evidence of multiorgan failure, are receiving vasopressors for hypotension, have liver disease defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or renal impairment defined as
       <italic>
        creatinine clearance (
       </italic>
       CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min, or receiving dialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for compassionate use may change, so applicants are encouraged to review the most up to date criteria for all potential patients. Clinicians should be cognizant that it typically takes a minimum of 72 hours for institutions to receive emergency institutional review board authorization (if required), protocol, and consent forms from Gilead, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval for the eIND, and eventual drug shipment. Clinicians should coordinate with their local information technology teams to build a medication order sentence into the electronic health record during this time. Patients may receive other antiviral therapies during the waiting period but must immediately discontinue them if they receive remdesivir for compassionate use.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting to note that the adaptive clinical trial protocol originally stated “remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of CYP-3A4”. This implies the existence of a drug-drug interaction with CYP3A4 substrate inhibitors such as ritonavir or voriconazole. However, the protocol also stated “although remdesivir is a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in vitro, coadministration with inhibitors of these CYP isoforms is unlikely to markedly increase remdesivir levels, as its metabolism is likely to be predominantly mediated by hydrolase activity.” Unlike the former, the latter statement is substantiated by well described chemistry of the molecule. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was contacted about this discrepancy and in collaboration with Gilead, this has been corrected. There is no reason to believe that any significant drug interactions between remdesivir and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are likely [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">

       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       Emerging clinical evidence and available in vitro data suggest remdesivir is a promising agent for the treatment of COVID-19. Institutions should explore clinical trial enrollment or compassionate use remdesivir for moderate-to-severe patients. Additional clinical data are eagerly anticipated and should help further define the role of this agent in COVID-19.

       Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine
      </title>
      <p>
       Chloroquine, an antimalarial agent with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, has gained significant interest as a potential therapeutic option for the management of COVID-19. In early February, Wang et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
        3
       </xref>
       ] demonstrated potent in vitro activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       at 48 hours of 1.13 µM in Vero E6 cells. These data were consistent with previous data for chloroquine’s inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in various cell lines, where EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       values of 1–8.8 and 3.0 µM were demonstrated, respectively [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">
        15
       </xref>
       ]. These findings have supported the clinical use of chloroquine, at a dose of 500 mg by mouth twice daily, in numerous clinical trials in China during this outbreak. Although the rationale for this dosing regimen remains unclear, and peer reviewed data from the trials are currently unavailable, it was announced in mid-February that promising early results have been demonstrated. Per Gao et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">
        16
       </xref>
       ], “thus far, results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing. Severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this development has been encouraging, supply issues in the United States and cardiovascular toxicity concerns limit the use of chloroquine. As an alternative, hydroxychloroquine, a compound that differs from chloroquine only by a single hydroxyl group, has garnered interest. Hydroxychloroquine is perceived as having better tolerability than chloroquine, which has led to long-term usage in rheumatological disorders. Historically, very limited data were published assessing the activity of hydroxychloroquine against coronaviruses. In 2006, Biot et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">
        17
       </xref>
       ] assessed the comparative inhibitory activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-1 in Vero cells. The authors demonstrated that chloroquine had an approximately 5-fold increased potency (EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       of 6.5 ± 3.2 µM) compared with that of hydroxychloroquine (EC

       </sub>
       of 34 ± 5 µM).

In vitro analyses in Vero cells demonstrated that the potency of hydroxychloroquine (EC
       <sub>

       of 0.72 µM) was greater than that of chloroquine (EC

       To inform optimal dosing of hydroxychloroquine, the investigators then performed PBPK modeling. In this analysis, the investigators utilized human population pharmacokinetic and rat lung penetration data for each compound to estimate free trough concentrations in the lung to EC

       for hydroxychloroquine regimens was set to ≥2.38 (day 1), 5.92 (day 3), and 18.9 (day 5), which were the R

       values predicted with the “efficacious” 500 mg by mouth twice-daily dosing of chloroquine [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">

       ]. Various dosing regimens were simulated, but 2 are particularly notable. The first was an oral loading dose of 1200 mg (divided 800 mg then 400 mg) on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily. This regimen led to significantly higher R
       <sub>

       on day 1 (33.3), day 3 (55.1), and day 5 (103) than those values demonstrated with chloroquine. The second regimen was a loading dose of 800 mg (400 mg × 2) on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily. This was also associated with higher R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values than chloroquine on day 1, 3, and 5 (corresponding to 21.0, 38.9, and 85.4, respectively) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">
        18

       ]. The authors concluded that these data support the lower dose regimen because R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values were significantly higher than those with the “proven efficacious” regimen of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily. Clinicians should note that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have half-lives of ~40 days [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">
        19
       </xref>
       ], and therefore short durations would likely provide prolonged courses of therapy. This was exemplified in the PBPK modeling in which R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values with hydroxychloroquine were predicted to still be above the targeted efficacy threshold on day 10, even with a 5-day course of therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although these data are encouraging for the potential role of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2, we caution against solely relying on these data to support dosing regimens for patients. The use of 500 mg of chloroquine by mouth twice daily as the reference for efficacy is rational given initial reports from China [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">
        16
       </xref>
       ], but it is important to note that this dosing still requires validation, and the improved R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values reported are largely driven by the finding that hydroxychloroquine was 7.6 times more potent than chloroquine in vitro. Although this enhanced potency may very well prove true as more data become available, this report is counter to the relative potency demonstrated with the structurally similar SARS-CoV-1 strain in 2006 in which chloroquine was approximately 5 times more potent than hydroxychloroquine. In addition, a recently published study has demonstrated that the EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       value for chloroquine is 1.13 µM [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
        3
       </xref>
       ], similar to the value reported for hydroxychloroquine in the analysis by Yao et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">

       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there are currently no efficacy data available for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, additional consideration should be given to the optimal dosing strategy. We use the following example to illustrate this point. If one were to consider these 2 compounds to be equally potent (identical EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       values) and utilize the PBPK data from Yao et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">
        18
       </xref>
       ], the 800 mg load, 400 mg daily regimen for hydroxychloroquine would yield R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values of 2.76, 5.11, and 11.2 on day 1, 3, and 5, respectively. These R
       <sub>
        LTEC
       </sub>
       values would be slightly lower than those achieved with 500 mg by mouth twice daily of chloroquine on day 3 and significantly lower than those on day 5, suggesting the potential need for a higher dose to have similar activity. Although the 400 mg daily regimen is the most common regimen currently being assessed in clinical trials, the rationale for that dose is currently unclear, and at least 1 clinical trial in China is using a higher dose of 800 mg by mouth daily.

       To this point, Gautret et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">
        20
       </xref>
       ] recently published their initial experience on the impact of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine by mouth every 8 hours on viral eradication in patients with COVID-19. The authors reported on 36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine and 16 control) who were COVID-19 positive and able to have nasopharyngeal sampling for the first 6 days of therapy (in the treated arm). The investigators demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine (14 of 20, 70%) was superior to standard of care (2 of 16, 12.5%;
       <italic>
        P
       </italic>
       = .001) in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. It is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin “to prevent bacterial super-infection” and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup (6 of 6, 100%) compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone (8 of 14, 57%). The authors concluded that azithromycin “reinforced” the SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved by hydroxychloroquine. Although these data are intriguing, certain limitations to this data set must be acknowledged. First, although viral eradication is an important endpoint, the authors did not report clinical outcomes in these patients. Second, the cohort initially contained 26 hydroxychloroquine patients, but 6 of them were removed from the analysis due to early cessation of hydroxychloroquine therapy including 3 PCR-positive patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), 1 PCR-negative patient who passed away, and 1 PCR-positive patient who discontinued hydroxychloroquine due to nausea. Finally, the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy arm included patients with significantly higher viral loads, represented by lower cycle threshold (C
       <sub>
        T
       </sub>
       ) values than those who received combination therapy. If the hydroxychloroquine monotherapy patients with C
       <sub>
        T
       </sub>
       values &lt;23 are separated from those with C
       <sub>
        T
       </sub>
       values ≥23, there is a notable discordance in viral eradication rates (1 of 5, 20% vs 7 of 9, 78%), with this latter number approaching the 6 of 6 demonstrated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy in which all patients had C
       <sub>
        T
       </sub>
       values ≥23. Given this finding, the small numbers in this study, the lack of clinical outcomes presented, the potential for additive toxicity with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and the desperate need to practice good antimicrobial stewardship during the COVID-19 pandemic, we would caution clinicians against using these data to support combination therapy.

       Despite all of the unknowns, the initial experience in China is encouraging for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for the management of COVID-19. Clinicians are encouraged to closely follow subsequent peer-reviewed publications from the ongoing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials, because others have raised concerns regarding the apparent in vitro and/or in vivo discordance witnessed with chloroquine in other viral infections [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">

       ]. Furthermore, if hydroxychloroquine is utilized, careful consideration for dose selection should be given in accordance with the aforementioned data, as well as considerations for when to initiate during the course of illness.

       Lopinavir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitor administered in fixed-dose combination with ritonavir (LPV/r), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that “boosts” lopinavir concentrations. Lopinavir seems to block the main protease of SARS-CoV-1, inhibiting viral replication [

       of LPV/r (8.5 µM) and LPV alone (11.6 µM), suggesting similar activity to that described for SARS CoV-1. Despite in vitro activity against MERS-CoV, therapeutic doses of LPV/r + INFb in mice models failed to reduce virus titer and exacerbated lung disease [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">

       ]. This is notable because this was the same study in which remdesivir demonstrated both more potent in vitro activity as well as in vivo efficacy. However, the in vivo animal data for MERS-CoV appears equivocal given that a nonhuman primate model demonstrated improved clinical and pathological features after LPV/r treatment [

       ] utilized combination therapy with LPV/r, ribavirin, and corticosteroids for any newly diagnosed patient with SARS-CoV-1 without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) starting in April 2003. Patients receiving LPV/r combination therapy (N = 41) were matched to historical patients receiving ribavirin plus corticosteroids (N = 111), and a significant reduction in the development of ARDS or death at 21 days was observed (2.4% vs 28.8%,

        P
       </italic>
       &lt; .001). This was corroborated by an expanded case-control matched study of 75 LPV/r-treated patients from the same center that demonstrated a significant reduction in pulse steroid use (27.3% vs 55.4%), intubation (0% vs 11%), and mortality (2.3% vs 15.6%) among patients who received LPV/r combination versus no LPV/r, respectively, as initial therapy [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">
        28
       </xref>
       ]. More important, the benefits of LPV/r were only demonstrated in patients who received initial treatment with LPV/r (defined as initiation of drug at time of SARS-CoV-1 diagnosis). There was no observed benefit when LPV/r was added as rescue or salvage therapy (death rate 12.9% vs 14%).
      </p>
      <p>
       This compelling mortality difference in SARS-CoV-1 and continued investigation in MERS-CoV led to inclusion of LPV/r in the Chinese SARS-CoV-2 guidelines at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg (2 capsules/tablets) by mouth twice a day for no more than 10 days even though to our knowledge, no in vitro data for LPV/r in SARS-CoV-2 exist [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">
        29
       </xref>
       ]. In pediatric patients weighing 15–40 kg, the recommended dose in the United States is 10 mg/kg suspension by mouth twice daily. There are 10 ongoing registered clinical trials in China, Korea, Thailand, and Hong Kong evaluating LPV/r as monotherapy or in combination with other antivirals (eg, ribavirin, interferon beta-1b) or traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real-world data for treatment of COVID-19 with LPV/r are emerging. Young et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">
        30
       </xref>
       ] reported outcomes of the first 18 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore, 5 of whom received LPV/r monotherapy. Three patients had reduction in oxygen requirements after treatment initiation; 2 deteriorated to respiratory failure. Two of 5 patients (40%) experienced clearance of viral shedding on treatment, and 4 of 5 (80%) experienced adverse events that precluded completion of the planned 14-day treatment course. Other published case reports or case series from Korea and China comprising 6 total patients describe decreased viral load and clinical improvement after LPV/r initiation. These data are difficult to interpret in light of concomitant drug therapies, varied time points of therapy initiation, heterogeneous severity of illness amongst patients, and the lack of comparator treatments [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">

The primary endpoint was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of 2 points on a 7-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, time until discharge, and virologic response on repeat oropharyngeal swabs over the course of the study. The median time from symptom onset to randomization was 13 (interquartile range [IQR], 11–16) days, and this did not differ between the groups. There was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement (16 [IQR, 13–17] days vs 16 [IQR, 15–17] days), time from randomization until discharge (12 [IQR, 10–16] days vs 14 [IQR, 11–16] days), or mortality (19.2 % vs 25.0%; absolute difference, −5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], −17.3% to 5.7%) between patients receiving LPV/r and standard care. When the 3 patients who died after randomization but before receiving LPV/r were removed, there remained no difference in mortality (16.7% vs 25.0%; absolute difference, −8.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −19.6 to 3.0). More important, there was no difference between treatment arms in reduction of viral loads over time between the 2 groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the available data, it is difficult to assess whether LPV/r has a role for the treatment of COVID-19 either as monotherapy or in combination. The data from SARS-CoV-1 are encouraging, but this must be weighed against the inferior performance in mouse models against MERS-CoV, the less potent in vitro activity compared with remdesivir and chloroquine for SARS-CoV-1, and limited data suggesting no advantage over standard care for SARS-CoV-2. More important, it warrants comment that in the recent randomized controlled trial in COVID-19 pneumonia, the median time from symptom onset to initiation of therapy was 13 days, and in the SARS-CoV-1 experience, therapy appeared effective if started early, but not as rescue and/or salvage. If used, drug interactions must be screened, and gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity, require close monitoring, particularly because elevated aspartate transaminase or ALT may exclude patients with COVID-19 from clinical trials. The LPV/r tablets can be taken without regard to food but should not be crushed because this decreases systemic exposure; solution should be used in patients who cannot receive intact tablets [

        39

      <p>
       Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits both membrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors. Interleukin-6, which is secreted by monocytes and macrophages, is one of the main drivers of immunologic response and symptoms in patients with cytokine-release syndrome (CRS). Although tocilizumab was first approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it has gained traction in recent years for treatment of patients with CRS following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy as a corticosteroid-sparing agent [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">
        42
       </xref>
       ]. Indeed, it received FDA approval for severe or life-threatening CAR T-associated CRS in 2017 due to its efficacy and safety profile. Although criteria for grading CRS severity varies by cancer center, it has been proposed to administer tocilizumab to CRS patients with any of the following: oxygen requirement &lt;40%, hypotension responsive to fluids or a low dose of a single vasoactive agent, or Grade 2 organ toxicity as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">
        43
       </xref>
       ]. Interleukin-6 antagonism may make a patient more susceptible to bacterial infection and has been associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving chronic therapy with tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis. In a case series of 53 adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Grade 3 CRS or higher was associated with increased risk of subsequent infection, but it was unclear whether tocilizumab or corticosteroid use promoted this risk [

       Hyperinflammatory states and cytokine storming, including elevated IL-6, has been reported in severe COVID-19 and were associated with increased mortality in patients in China [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">
        36
       </xref>
       ]. A preprint (nonpeer reviewed) case series of 21 patients treated with tocilizumab between February 5 and 14, 2020 in China reported marked success, including rapid resolution of fever and C-reactive protein, decreased oxygen requirements, and resolution of lung opacities on computerized tomography imaging [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">
        46
       </xref>
       ]. The authors state the patients all had “routine treatment for a week” before tocilizumab, which was described as “standard care according to national treatment guidelines” including lopinavir, methylprednisolone, and other supportive care. All patients had IL-6 analyzed before tocilizumab administration with a mean value of 132.38 ± 278.54 pg/mL (normal &lt;7 pg/mL). It should be noted that in the United States, IL-6 monitoring is a send-out laboratory for most institutions with a turnaround time of 3–7 days. No adverse events were described in the Chinese cohort; however, long-term assessment was not done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunotherapy with tocilizumab is listed as a treatment option for severe or critical cases of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6 in the 7th edition of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">
        29
       </xref>
       ]. The recommended dose is 4–8 mg/kg or 400 mg standard dose IV once, with the option to repeat a dose in 12 hours (not to exceed a total dose of 800 mg). There are 2 ongoing trials in China evaluating safety and efficacy of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but none registered in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       We anticipate that more data regarding tocilizumab use in patients with COVID-19 will emerge, and it will be imperative for clinicians to evaluate it closely. The optimal timing of tocilizumab administration during the disease course is not yet defined, nor is there a known IL-6 threshold for progression to severe disease. It is imperative to continue to follow the long-term outcomes in these patients to assess the risk versus benefit of tocilizumab.

       Corticosteroids
      </title>
      <p>
       Similar to other severe respiratory tract infections, there is significant interest and controversy surrounding the role of corticosteroids for the management of severe pneumonia due to coronaviruses. The potential benefit of these agents to blunt the inflammatory cascade seen in severe disease needs to be carefully weighed against the concerns for secondary infections, adverse events, and other complications of corticosteroid therapy. The data assessing the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive care for severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia are difficult to interpret. Given the retrospective observational nature of these analyses, there is significant confounding by indication that is difficult to control or correct for in addition to limited sample sizes. Patients who receive corticosteroids have a higher severity of illness, are more likely to require invasive interventions, and are more likely to be receiving intensive care. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity with regard to timing of corticosteroid initiation, which can significantly impact disease progression and likelihood of response. All of these features lead to patients who receive steroids being at increased risk for poor outcomes. In addition, there is great variation in agent and dosage used, which can impact both safety and efficacy. Therefore, clinicians making any therapeutic decisions based on the literature for corticosteroids need to keep these considerations in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clinical data for use of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-1 infections are mixed. Multiple analyses show no impact on outcomes [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">
        47
       </xref>
       ], one report demonstrates decreased mortality in critically ill patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0048">
        48
       </xref>
       ], and others have documented worse outcomes for patients receiving steroids, including increased time to viral clearance [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">
        49
       </xref>
       ] or an increase in the composite endpoint of ICU admission or death [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">
        50
       </xref>
       ]. In MERS-CoV, receipt of corticosteroids has been associated with a delayed time until viral clearance in a large cohort (n = 309) of infected patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">
        51
       </xref>
       ]. However, this same data set showed a nonsignificant reduction in 90-day mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.52–1.07) after accounting for differences between the groups in a regression model accounting for time-varying exposures. Finally, recent evidence in SARS-CoV-2 suggested a decrease in mortality in patients with ARDS with the receipt of corticosteroids (23 of 50 [46%] vs 21 of 34 [62%] without; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20–0.72) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">
        52
       </xref>
       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       As demonstrated, the data for corticosteroids are inconsistent, confusing, and inconclusive. Although target patients in whom corticosteroids will improve outcomes may exist (eg, those with cytokine-related lung injury who may develop rapidly progressive pneumonia), that population remains ill-defined [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0053">
        53
       </xref>
       ]. Clinicians need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of corticosteroids on the individual patient level. This need for a risk-benefit assessment in individual patients and careful consideration of dose is exemplified in the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China where the authors state, “Based on respiratory distress and chest imaging, may consider glucocorticoid that is equivalent to methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days or less. Note that large-dose glucocorticoid suppresses immune system and could delay clearance of SARS-CoV-2.” [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">
        29
       </xref>
       ] A recent consensus statement from the Chinese Thoracic Society recommends a lower dose, ≤0.5–1 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone for ≤7 days in select patients, after careful consideration of risks and benefits [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0053">
        53
       </xref>
       ]. Randomized controlled trial data are urgently needed to clearly define the role of corticosteroids in COVID-19.

       Ribavirin With or Without Interferon
      </title>
      <p>
       Ribavirin, a guanosine analog that terminates RNA synthesis, was first approved in the 1980s and has been used clinically for respiratory syncytial virus, viral hemorrhagic fever, and in combination with interferon for hepatitis C. As mentioned previously (see LPV/r section), it was evaluated against SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 and used clinically in combination with corticosteroids and/or interferon in the absence of other treatment options; however, outcomes were either poor or ill-defined [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">

       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">
        55
       </xref>
       ]. The doses required for antiviral activity against SARS range from 1.2 to 2.4 grams by mouth every 8 hours, which are associated with excessive toxicity to patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">
        56
       </xref>
       ]. Wang et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">
        3
       </xref>
       ] evaluated the in vitro activity of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 and found an EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       of 109.5 µM, which was over 100 times less potent than remdesivir. The risk of hematologic toxicity at high doses likely outweighs potential clinical benefit, and therefore ribavirin was not considered a viable candidate for further investigation by the WHO research and development plan for SARS-CoV-2 given its lack of in vitro efficacy, toxicity profile, and poor outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interferons (α, β) may stimulate innate antiviral responses and are expected to have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, given the previously described activity demonstrated against MERS-CoV (EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       175 IU/mL). However, toxicities are substantial including severe cytopenias, hepatotoxicity (including fatality), neuropsychiatric events, and risk of developing fatal or life-threatening ischemia or infection, particularly when combined with ribavirin. This combination was not associated with improved mortality or enhanced viral clearance in a retrospective analysis of patients infected with MERS-CoV who were initiated on combination therapy within 1–3 days of ICU admission [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">
        57
       </xref>
       ]. Despite the limited to poor data, Chinese guidelines recommend ribavirin 500 mg IV 2–3 times daily in combination with LPV/r or inhaled interferon-α (5 million units nebulized twice daily) as one of the “standard treatment” options for COVID-19. Various combinations of ribavirin, interferon, and other antiviral agents are currently being studied in several clinical trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the poor in vitro activity, an absence of animal or human data supporting its use, and a significant toxicity profile, we recommend avoiding use of ribavirin in patients with COVID-19 at this time. Although interferons may be useful as adjunctive care, they pose a significant risk to critically ill patients, and in the absence of supportive data they also cannot be currently recommended.

       Oseltamivir and Baloxavir
      </title>
      <p>
       Given their antiviral activity against influenza, considerable attention has been paid to oseltamivir, and to a lesser degree baloxavir, as potential treatment options for COVID-19. This was exacerbated by the initial report from Huang et al [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">
        1
       </xref>
       ] in Wuhan where patients managed with COVID-19 received oseltamivir in addition to broad-spectrum antimicrobials. It is important to note that use of oseltamivir was not as targeted therapy of SARS-CoV-2 but rather driven by the lack of a knowledge of the causative pathogen at the time of treatment and the desire to empirically treat influenza. The authors do not suggest the use of oseltamivir for COVID-19 in that publication, and there are no data that suggest in vitro activity of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the only data assessing oseltamivir activity against coronaviruses demonstrated it to be ineffective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-1, even at a concentration of 10 000 µM/L [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">
        56
       </xref>
       ]. Coronaviruses do not utilize neuraminidase, and thus there is no enzyme to be inhibited by oseltamivir. This would hold true for zanamivir, peramivir, or any other neuraminidase inhibitor agents. Similarly, neither a defined mechanism nor in vitro data have suggested that baloxavir would demonstrate activity against SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. Therefore, given the critical need for these agents in the management of influenza and concern for drug shortages with oseltamivir, these agents should be avoided in patients with COVID-19 once influenza has been ruled out.

      CONCLUSIONS
     </title>
     <p>
      Appropriate management strategies for patients with COVID-19 are a rapidly evolving therapeutic challenge, and the optimal agents (if any) to treat infection or prevent progression to critical illness remain ill-defined. Although certain agents listed in this review are encouraging, and the potential benefit of therapy likely outweighs the relatively minor risk of adverse events from short-course therapy, the evidence remains inconclusive and changes almost daily.
     </p>
     <p>
      Patient populations who warrant therapy and the timing of initiation of therapy need to be defined. Given that disease progression can occur rapidly in stable patients and that viral loads are highest early in the infection course, the authors of this review opine that rapid initiation of therapy in high-risk populations (patients who are hospitalized or outpatients who are at high risk of complications) is rational and should be considered, ideally in the context of a well-controlled, adequately powered trial. More important, however, this strategy is not without risk and needs to be weighed against potential adverse events (that remain poorly defined) and impending drug shortages with increases in use of these agents. To help address these concerns, careful consideration should be given to duration of therapy with many clinical trials and institutional protocols recommending 5–7 days for uncomplicated disease. Duration of therapy should be individualized to the patient and the progression of disease.
     </p>
     <p>
      Clinicians must continually monitor and adapt as new literature becomes available. Caution should be applied because the bulk of the available clinical data are uncontrolled, not peer reviewed, or even unpublished. Given these limitations, it is critical that institutions and clinicians report their experiences with the management and treatment of COVID-19 to the medical community so that we may further modify and optimize treatment recommendations and pathways.

      <abstract>
       <p>
        After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

     <p>
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that co-infect humans and other vertebrate animals. CoV infections affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and central nervous systems of humans, livestock, birds, bats, mice, and many other wild animals [

      ]. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 were both coronaviruses that transmitted from animals to humans [

      ]. The source of unexplained pneumonia was first discovered in Wuhan in Dec, 2019, and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients. It belongs to a new evolutionary branch within the CoV. On Feb. 11th, 2020, the new coronavirus was officially renamed “SARS-CoV-2” from “2019-nCoV” [

      ]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-viruses-12-00244">

      </xref>
      ]. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, SARS-CoV-2 was most likely transmitted from wild bats to humans, and all the above three CoVs can transmit from person to person [

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-viruses-12-00244">
        24

       3.2. Clinical Symptoms
      </title>
      <p>
       The initial symptoms of SARS patients were fever (100%), cough (61.8%), myalgia (48.7%), dyspnea (40.8%), and diarrhea (31.6%) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-12-00244">

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-viruses-12-00244">
        30
       </xref>

       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-12-00244">
        29
       </xref>
       ]. The duration from disease onset to severe respiratory distress was an average of 9.8 ± 3.0 days [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-12-00244">
        29
       </xref>
       ]. During the disease course, some patients developed leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia with an upregulation of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-viruses-12-00244">
        29

       In comparison, COVID-19 showed similar trends with SARS patients [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-viruses-12-00244">
        28
       </xref>
       ]. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of the patients, while nasal congestion, runny nose, and other symptoms of the upper respiratory tract are rare. Beijing Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention indicated that the typical case of COVID-19 has a progressive aggravation process. COVID-19 can be classified into light, normal, severe, and critical types based on the severity of the disease [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-viruses-12-00244">
        31
       </xref>
       ]: (1) Mild cases—the clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia was found on the chest computed tomography (CT); (2) normal cases—fever, respiratory symptoms, and patients found to have imaging manifestations of pneumonia; (3) severe cases—one of the following three conditions: Respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min (in resting state, refers to oxygen saturation ≤ 93%), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical cases—one of the following three conditions: Respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or the associated failure of other organs requiring the intensive care unit [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-viruses-12-00244">
        32
       </xref>
       ]. The current clinical data shows that the majority of the deaths occurred in the older patients. However, severe cases have been documented in young adults who have unique factors, particularly those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hepatitis B. Those with a long-term use of hormones or immunosuppressants, and decreased immune function, are likely to get severely infected.

       ]. AEC2 have been identified to be key binding residues and functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and it can also protect alveolar cells [

        103
       </xref>
       ]. The binding of spike protein to ACE2 and the subsequent downregulation of this receptor contribute to severe alveolar injury during SARS [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-viruses-12-00244">
        49
       </xref>
       ]. The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE, and the stimulation of type 1A angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1A) can lead to the increase of pulmonary vascular permeability, which potentially explains the increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [

        104

       ]. ACE2-transfected T cells form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. The virus was shown to replicate effectively in ACE2-transfected, but not in mock-transfected T cells. Antibodies targeting ACE2 can block viral replication in Vero-E6 cells [

       ].
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, Ji et al. demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-viruses-12-00244">
        51
       </xref>
       ]. Among SRAS-CoV spike protein’s fourteen residues predicted to interact directly with human ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV, eight amino acids are well conserved in homology SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-viruses-12-00244">

        102
       </xref>
       ]. At the same time, Wan et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to infect humans, bats, civets, monkeys, and swine, but not mice [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106-viruses-12-00244">
        106
       </xref>
       ]. Compared to previously reported SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003), but less efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2002) [
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106-viruses-12-00244">
        106
       </xref>
       ]. The mutation of proteins determines two important characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2: A higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat-like SARS-CoV, but a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV [

     </title>
     <p>
      As a large number of people have left Wuhan, the control of the epidemic situation is extremely urgent, and the treatments of COVID-19 are imminent. On Feb. 14th, 2020, there were more than 54,000 confirmed patients in Hubei province, China [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55-viruses-12-00244">
       55
      </xref>
      ]. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, the prognosis of patients solely depends on their age and physical condition [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74-viruses-12-00244">
       74
      </xref>
      ]. Although it was reported that the clinically recovered patients exceed the number of dead, the majority of the patients are still not cured in hospital. In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it difficult for vaccine development. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop more sensitive inspection methods and effective drugs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven type of CoVs have been identified to cause human disease [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107-viruses-12-00244">
       107
      </xref>
      ]. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans. The other four human CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory diseases, although some of them can cause severe infections in infants, young children, and elderly individuals [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-viruses-12-00244">

      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108-viruses-12-00244">
       108
      </xref>
      ]. The latest one is SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-viruses-12-00244">
       11
      </xref>
      ]. Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-12-00244-t002">
       Table 2
      </xref>
      ). Hence, clinical drugs and therapies for treating SARS may be used as a reference for COVID-19 treatment [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74-viruses-12-00244">
       74
      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the well-known SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as one Merbecovirus subgenus of β-CoVs, is also extremely invasive. MERS-CoV is the pathogen of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which can infect both humans and animals, and can be transmitted through camels [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109-viruses-12-00244">
       109
      </xref>
      ]. It mainly occurs in Saudi Arabia and has a high mortality rate [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66-viruses-12-00244">
       66
      </xref>
      ]. Studies had demonstrated that the clinical course of SARS and MERS was highly similar, and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66-viruses-12-00244">
       66
      </xref>
      ]. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV. It will be very interesting to study the relationship among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 that may be exploited for future developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although more and more studies for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up since the outbreak of this epidemic COVID-19, based on our comparison, we propose some key questions to be clarified in future studies (
      <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-12-00244-t003">
       Table 3
      </xref>
      ). In-depth understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will reveal more targets for better therapy of COVID-19.

        The genetically diverse
        <italic>
         Orthocoronavirinae
        </italic>
        (CoV) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock. Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including
        <italic>
         Filoviridae
        </italic>
        ,
        <italic>
         Paramyxoviridae

         Pneumoviridae

        , and
        <italic>
         Orthocoronavirinae
        </italic>
        , through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC
        <sub>
         50
        </sub>
        values. Of known CoVs, the members of the
        <italic>
         deltacoronavirus
        </italic>
        genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.

      The genetically diverse

       Orthocoronavirinae

      (CoV) family is divided into four genera (

      </italic>
      and
      <italic>
       beta

      genera. Human CoVs OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 cause 10% of all upper and lower respiratory tract infections, which typically present with common-cold like symptoms but can cause more severe disease in young children as well as people with underlying respiratory conditions (i.e. asthma, COPD) and the elderly (

       Dijkman et al., 2012

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
       Falsey et al., 2002
      </xref>
      ). In children, severe respiratory tract CoV infections require hospitalization in about 10% of cases and have been associated with febrile seizure in those less than 1 year old (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">
       Carman et al., 2018

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">
       Heimdal et al., 2019
      </xref>
      ). CoV infection can also be severe in the elderly requiring hospitalization and can even cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">
       Falsey et al., 2002

       Vassilara et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). Zoonotic CoVs have a natural predilection for emergence into new host species giving rise to new diseases most recently exemplified in humans by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">
       de Wit et al., 2016

      ). Interestingly, all known human CoVs are thought to have emerged as zoonoses from wild or domestic animals (

       (0.14, 0.17, 0.16 μM, mean = 0.15 μM, standard deviation = 0.015) was highly consistent from experiment to experiment (

       obtained in Huh7 cells was &gt;10 μM. Thus, for this assay system, the selectivity index (SI = CC

       ) was &gt;66. This assay is driven by the detection nucleocapsid, the most abundant viral protein during CoV replication. Thus, the dynamic range of detection is maximized due to our antibody and viral antigen pairing, which may have been notably lower had we chosen to measure the expression of a viral protein with lower expression (e.g. non-structural protein 2) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">
        Neuman et al., 2008

       ). Conversely, due to the high abundance of nucleocapsid mRNA, RDV may cause reductions in viral RNAs that are not detectable in this assay until a certain threshold is achieved that results in significant diminishment of nucleocapsid protein production.

       RNA FISH and qRT-PCR demonstrate RDV diminishes HCoV-OC43 viral RNA
      </title>
      <p id="p0085">
       We aimed to corroborate the protein-based FFRA data for HCoV-OC43 with multiple viral RNA-based techniques. First, we employed an RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy-based technique. The HCoV-OC43 ORF1a region of the genomic RNA was stained with 48 unique oligonucleotide probes conjugated to a Quasar 570 fluorophore. With RNA FISH visualized through fluorescence microscopy, we observed an RDV dose-dependent reduction in HCoV-OC43 genomic RNA (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       A). To quantify this trend, cell number in three random microscopy fields per drug condition was determined by automated enumeration of Hoechst stained nuclei along with the total HCoV-OC43 FISH area/field (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       B). The number of nuclei per random field were consistent among drug conditions (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       C). Similarly, we observed more than a 5-log difference in HCoV-OC43 FISH area comparing mock and infected cells in the absence of RDV. At the highest dose of RDV (0.25 μM), HCoV-OC43 FISH signal was not detected but as RDV dose was diminished, virus replication gradually increased to levels similar to that in untreated cells (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       C). Similar data were generated from concurrent and equivalent studies by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) measuring both genomic (ORF1b) and subgenomic (nucleocapsid) viral RNA species. Due to the increased sensitivity of PCR-based assays over microscopy, the dynamic range of the qRT-PCR assay was more than 6 logs when comparing mock to infected replicates (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       D). Similar to FISH, levels of HCoV-OC43 genomic and subgenomic RNA treated with 0.25 μM RDV were similar to that of mock infected and increased in an RDV dose dependent manner. The resultant EC
       <sub>
        50
       </sub>
       (0.02 μM) generated from the genomic RNA assay was 7.5-fold lower than that obtained by FFRA but this is not unexpected given the increased sensitivity of PCR-based assays. It is important to note that our qPCR assay may be underestimating the potency of RDV. The antiviral effect of RDV has been reported to be through delayed chain termination (

      ). Although rare, endemic human CoV like HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 can also cause severe respiratory disease (pneumonia, ARDS, etc.) in subsets of patients, with presentation similar to SARS- and MERS-CoV (

      ). Thus, the capacity for human CoV to cause severe disease is not unique to emerging viruses like SARS- and MERS-CoV. While there are no CoV specific antivirals approved for human use, many approved therapies for other indications have been evaluated against CoV in hopes of repurposing. The antimalarial, chloroquine, reportedly has moderate antiviral activity

      ). However, the full breadth of activity against CoV has yet to be determined. Previously, we demonstrated antiviral activity of RDV against SARS-CoV and related zoonotic bat-CoV (beta 2b), MERS-CoV, and related bat-CoV (beta 2c), HCoV-NL63 (alpha 1b), and MHV (beta 2a) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">
       Sheahan et al., 2017
      </xref>
      ). In addition, the parental nucleoside (GS-441524) of RDV (i.e. the prodrug of GS-5734) has a reported EC
      <sub>
       50
      </sub>
      of 0.7 μM against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP, alpha 1a CoV) and could reverse lethal disease in experimental infectious of cats (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">
       Murphy et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). Here, we show that RDV has potent antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and PDCoV which are in subgenera beta 2a, alpha 1b, and delta 4, respectively. While we have not yet tested a representative from alpha 1a (e.g. PEDV) or gamma (e.g. avian infectious bronchitis virus, AIBV), CoV members with similar RdRps, like HCoV-229E, have been evaluated. The other outstanding subgenera yet to be evaluated is beta 2d, which is currently comprised of only bat-CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">
       Lau et al., 2010
      </xref>
      ). Culture systems for beta 2d viruses are currently not available. Thus, with this report, we demonstrate potent antiviral activity of RDV against representatives capturing near family-wide CoV RdRp diversity including
      <italic>
       deltacoronavirus
      </italic>
      which have the most divergent RdRp of known CoV as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV. These data suggest that future emerging CoV may be similarly susceptible to the inhibition by RDV.

      The CoV RNA replication complex is comprised of multiple viral proteins one of which, the viral RdRp, generates nascent genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs. While the CoV RdRp is relatively conserved, the amino acid percent similarity can vary from 67 to 100%. For antiviral drugs that interact and interfere with RdRp function, variation in amino acid sequence and resultant protein structure can have profound effects on susceptibility. Lo et al. recently reported a correlation between nucleotide interaction motifs “A” and “B” in the RdRp and susceptibility to the antiviral activity of RDV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">
       Lo et al., 2017
      </xref>
      ). Motifs A and B were highly conserved within virus families and generally correlated with RDV antiviral activity but for members of
      <italic>
       Flaviviridae
      </italic>
      (i.e. West Nile virus EC
      <sub>
       50

      = &gt;30 μM, yellow fever virus EC
      <sub>

      = 2.1 μM, hepatitis C virus EC
      <sub>
       50
      </sub>
      = 4.1 μM), the potency of RDV was mixed even though motifs A and B were for the most part highly conserved. Thus, other factors in the RdRp structure or function likely mediate this discrepancy. Mutations (F476L and V553L), identified through passage of MHV in the presence of RDV, provide partial resistance to RDV antiviral activity (i.e. 2.4-fold and 5-fold shift in EC
      <sub>
       50
      </sub>
      , respectively). Interestingly, though MHV and SARS-CoV RdRp are 80% identical, resistance is transferable to SARS-CoV via reverse genetic introduction of homologous mutations (F480L and V557L) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
       Agostini et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). Here, we show that PDCoV, a member of the
      <italic>
       deltacoronavirus
      </italic>
      genus, is exquisitely sensitive to RDV despite naturally harboring a one of the two RdRp resistance mutations identified in MHV. Without a reverse genetic system for PDCoV, it is not possible to definitively determine if this homologous mutation (483L) alters the antiviral effect of RDV on PDCoV. In the very recent publication describing the SARS-CoV RdRp structure, the authors suggest the F480L mutation, located in the fingers domain contacting motif B, impacts active site dynamics related to catalysis (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">
       Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019
      </xref>
      ). Interestingly, Kirchdorfer and Ward suggest the V557L (V553L in MHV) resistance mutation in the SARS-CoV RdRp increases stringency of base pairing thereby increasing polymerase fidelity allowing for better exclusion of RDV from the active site (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">
       Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019
      </xref>
      ). Future studies will focus on passage of PDCoV for RDV resistance to determine if genetically divergent CoV take similar or different paths towards acquiring RDV resistance.

      Broad-spectrum approaches maximize the utility of antivirals with proven efficacy against current epidemic strains as well as zoonotic viruses that will likely seed future emergence. Here, we further describe the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against both human and zoonotic CoV. We found that RDV had decreased potency against 229E and PDCoV in the porcine kidney cell line, LLC-PK1, although these viruses were similarly sensitive in the human hepatoma cell, Huh7. Although different from RDV, normal uptake and metabolism has been reported for the nucleoside analog lamivudine (i.e. 3 TC) in LLC-PK1 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">
       Leung and Bendayan, 2001
      </xref>
      ). Interestingly, uptake and the antiviral activity of ribavirin, another nucleoside analog, was reported to vary significantly among human liver cell lines, which was directly correlated with antiviral activity against poliovirus indicating that variation in small molecule uptake/transport can impact antiviral efficacy (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">
       Ibarra and Pfeiffer, 2009
      </xref>
      ). While RDV does have altered metabolism in mice due to the circulating serum carboxylesterase 1c (
      <italic>
       Ces1c
      </italic>
      ) that is absent in humans (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">
       Sheahan et al., 2017
      </xref>
      ), it is potently antiviral against MHV in mouse DBT cells (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">
       Agostini et al., 2018
      </xref>
      ). Therefore, the Ces1c metabolism issue with RDV is specific to the mouse
      <italic>
       in vivo
      </italic>
      system. Although it is likely that LLC-PK1 cells are deficient in a cellular process required for the antiviral activity of RDV, without further testing in other porcine cell lines, it is not possible to ascertain whether this is cell line specific or species specific or to speculate about the potential efficacy against PDCoV in pigs. Here, we have focused our efforts on developing
      <italic>
       in vitro
      </italic>
      assays for human and zoonotic CoV but animal models exist for HCoV-229E and OC43 as well as PDCoV within which
      <italic>
       in vivo
      </italic>
      efficacy could be evaluated (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">
       Jung et al., 2015
      </xref>
      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">
       Lassnig et al., 2005

      ;
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">
       St-Jean et al., 2004
      </xref>
      ). Given that we have demonstrated antiviral activity against a panel of CoVs with the great RdRp diversity, RDV may too be efficacious against future emerging CoV as long as they fall within the spectrum of known genetic diversity. To prepare for the potential of drug resistance to single therapies, multiple novel broad-spectrum antiviral strategies are needed. Moreover, with desired safety profiles, combination broad-spectrum antiviral therapies with disparate mechanisms of action may be more effective at treating emerging viral syndromes in parallel prior to etiological agent identification. If available, new antiviral therapies would markedly expand the current treatment options available to clinicians. The current front-line agents treating emerging viral epidemics (i.e. ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and corticosteroids) often do not improve outcomes over supportive care (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">
       Zumla et al., 2016
      </xref>
      ). Therefore, our studies provide further evidence of the antiviral activity of RDV against endemic, epidemic, and zoonotic CoV, which may be useful in treating patients with severe endemic CoV infections, MERS-CoV patients or emerging CoV diseases in the future provided that the drug safety profile is proven to be compatible with its use in the affected patient populations.

        Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved,
posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an
investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA
viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS–CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS–CoV
nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a
polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS–CoV RdRp by RDV. We
initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form
of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the
selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it
is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once
incorporated at position
        <italic>
         i
        </italic>
        , the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at
position
        <italic>
         i
        </italic>
        + 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA
chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from
excision by the viral 3′–5′ exonuclease activity. Together, these
results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based
assays.

      initiated a global effort to identify effective treatments focusing on agents with
demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS–CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS–CoV), or related positive-sense RNA viruses. Although currently there are no
approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections available,
preclinical data with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (RDV) are promising, and human safety
data are available (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       1
      </xref>
      ). This compound shows a broad
spectrum of antiviral activities against several RNA viruses (

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
       5
      </xref>
      ). RDV was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
       2
      </xref>
      ). Cell-culture and animal studies revealed potent
antiviral activities against filoviruses, including the Ebola virus (EBOV) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
       4
      </xref>
      ). Subsequent studies have shown that RDV is also active
against coronaviruses with divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
       5
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
       6
      </xref>
      ). However,
biochemical data that support these findings and provide a possible mechanism of action are
not available.
     </p>
     <p>
      The triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) was shown to inhibit the RdRp of respiratory
syncytial virus (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
       4
      </xref>
      ), Nipah virus, and EBOV (

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
       8
      </xref>
      ), which are all
nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses. Active Ebola RdRp contains the viral L protein in
complex with viral protein 35 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">

      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
       10
      </xref>
      ). Viral protein 35 is the functional counterpart of
the P protein of respiratory syncytial virus and Nipah (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
       7
      </xref>

      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
       12
      </xref>
      ). Previously, we generated recombinant Ebola RdRp for the study of nucleotide
analog inhibitors (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
       8
      </xref>
      ). Enzyme kinetics show that
RDV-TP is able to compete with its natural counterpart ATP for incorporation. The
selectivity of ATP over the inhibitor is ∼4-fold. Once incorporated at position
      <italic>
       i
      </italic>
      , the compound causes inhibition of RNA synthesis predominantly at
position
      <italic>
       i

      + 5. Delayed chain termination is therefore a plausible
mechanism of action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Progress has also been made in characterizing the SARS–CoV RdRp complex (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
       13

      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">

      </xref>
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
       15
      </xref>
      ). Biochemical data suggest that the active complex is
composed of at least three viral nonstructural proteins nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12. The RNA
polymerase nsp12 alone displays low processivity. Synthesis of longer reaction products
require the additional presence of nsp7 and nsp8. Although a heterotrimer was not stable,
nsp7 and nsp8 can be linked together to form a complex with nsp12 (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
       15
      </xref>
      ). Here we developed a novel expression system for the MERS–CoV
RdRp complex and studied the mechanism of action of remdesivir. Co-expression of the MERS
nsp5 protease with nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 in insect cells yielded a stable complex composed
of nsp8 and nsp12. We demonstrate that this complex is active on model primer/template
substrates that adequately mimic the elongation state. Most importantly, selectivity
measurements determined here under the inherent limitations of the steady-state conditions
revealed that incorporation of the inhibitor is more efficient than its natural counterpart,
and delayed chain termination is observed at position

from SARS–CoV (

approach whereby MERS nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 were co-expressed in insect cells as a
part a polyprotein (NCBI accession no. YP_009047202.1). The polyprotein was
post-translationally cleaved by the nsp5 protease at its original cleavage sites (

       The WT MERS–CoV RdRp complex was tested for RNA synthesis on short model

recently used the same model substrates for the study of other RdRp enzymes (

       P]GTP is the first incorporated nucleotide,

RdRp activity. It has recently been reported that SARS–CoV nsp8 displays RNA
primase activity that yields short (∼6-mer) reaction products (

However, structural data are inconsistent with the formation of a primase active site in
SARS–CoV nsp8 (

       Inhibition of EBOV RdRp and MERS–CoV RdRp with RDV
      </title>
      <p>
       For EBOV RdRp, it has been challenging to identify a sequence with a single site of
incorporation for the RDV. Hence, we devised two different RNA templates that allow
multiple and single incorporations, respectively, as shown in
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <italic>
        A
       </italic>
       . These sequences were used to compare the
inhibitory effects of RDV on EBOV RdRp and MERS RdRp. For EBOV RdRp, we observed delayed
chain termination at position
       <italic>
        i
       </italic>
       + 5 as previously described (
       <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <italic>
        B
       </italic>
       ) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
        8
       </xref>
       ). However, the template that provides a single site of RDV-TP incorporation
also shows reductions in full-length RNA synthesis. In contrast, the MERS RdRp complex
yields the full-length RNA product with both sequences. The inhibition patterns with
RDV-TP differ markedly from our results with EBOV RdRp. RNA synthesis is arrested at
positions
       <italic>
        i
       </italic>
       + 3 and
       <italic>
        i
       </italic>
       + 4 with a template that provides
multiple sites of incorporation of the inhibitor, and the full-length product is only seen
as a faint band. The template that allows only a single incorporation event yields RNA
synthesis arrest at position
       <italic>
        i
       </italic>
       + 3 and an increased amount of the
full-length product. Hence, the mechanism of inhibition is likely delayed chain
termination for both EBOV RdRp and MERS RdRp, although the specific patterns show subtle
differences. In the absence of inhibitor, RNA synthesis and full-length product formation
is generally more efficient with MERS–CoV RdRp. This could also help to explain
that a small amount of full-length product is still seen with this enzyme in the presence

       Competitive inhibition of RNA synthesis by RDV-TP
      </title>
      <p>
       To study whether RDV-TP is able to compete with its natural counterpart ATP, we monitored
RNA synthesis at a fixed concentration of NTPs (0.02 μ
       <sc>
        m
       </sc>
       ) and increasing
concentrations of RDV-TP (

       ,
       <italic>
        top panel

       ). Increasing concentrations of RDV-TP caused a reduction of
the 14-mer product caused by increases in RNA synthesis arrest at position

       + 3. Formation of the full-length 14-mer product is not evident at
RDV-TP concentrations higher than 0.041 μ
       <sc>
        m
       </sc>
       . Quantification of the data
revealed an IC

       for RDV-TP of 0.032 μ
       <sc>

       ). This value is only
1.5-fold higher than the ATP concentration, which points to an efficient use of the
inhibitor. Increasing concentrations of ATP caused a corresponding increase in

efficiency of nucleotide analog substrate utilization are driven solely by differences in

       values. The data show an unexpectedly low
selectivity values for RDV-TP (0.35-fold), whereas ara-ATP (749-fold), and 2′CM-ATP
(165-fold) are both associated with high selectivity values. The selectivity value for
RDV-TP below 1 suggests that incorporation of the inhibitor is more efficient as compared
with the natural substrate. Commonly, the nucleotide analog is less efficiently
incorporated, as seen with ara-ATP and 2′CM-ATP.

     <p>
      Broad spectrum antivirals or compounds with demonstrated activity against SARS–CoV
or MERS–CoV are now considered for the treatment of infection caused by the novel
coronavirus SARS–CoV-2. The nucleotide analog RDV has been tested in a randomized,
controlled trial for Ebola virus disease (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
       18
      </xref>
      ).
Although two other investigational therapies were more efficacious than RDV, an antiviral
effect has been demonstrated. This compound also shows a broad spectrum of antiviral
activities against coronaviruses
      <italic>
       in vitro
      </italic>
      and in animal models (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       1
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">

      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">

      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
       20
      </xref>
      ). Moreover,
screening of a compound library of Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs
revealed that the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor lopinavir is active against
MERS–CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">
       21
      </xref>
      ). This drug is currently tested
in a clinical trial for the treatment of MERS–CoV in combination with
interferon-β and ritonavir (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
       22
      </xref>
      ), which is used
for pharmacological boosting. A recent study compared the efficacy of the combination of
lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-β with RDV in cell culture and showed that RDV was
significantly more active against MERS–CoV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
       1
      </xref>
      ).
Here we focused on the biochemical evaluation of RDV to provide a better understanding of
its broad spectrum of antiviral activities and the underlying mechanism of action.

       In vitro
      </italic>
      selection experiments with the coronavirus model murine hepatitis
virus (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
       5
      </xref>
      ) resulted in two variants with
resistance-conferring mutations in nsp12. These data provide strong evidence to show that
RdRp is the target for RDV. Our biochemical data corroborate that the RNA polymerase of
MERS–CoV is indeed the drug target. We demonstrate that MERS nsp8 and nsp12 form an
active, binary complex. RDV-TP is utilized as a substrate and competes with its natural
counterpart ATP. Natural nucleotide pools are commonly more efficiently incorporated when
compared with nucleotide analogs. However, in this case, we observe that incorporation of
the nucleotide analog is significantly more efficient.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once added into the growing RNA chain, the inhibitor does not cause immediate chain
termination. The presence of the 3′-hydroxyl group allows the addition of three more
nucleotides until RNA synthesis is arrested at position
      <italic>
       i
      </italic>
      + 3. A fraction
of the extended primer overcomes this arrest, which can lead to full-length product
formation. Full-length product formation is considerably reduced when the inhibitor is added
at consecutive sites. The efficient rate of RDV-TP incorporation may translate in multiple
incorporation events
      <italic>
       in vivo
      </italic>
      , and this could add to the overall potency of
the drug. It is important to note that other parameters including the intracellular
concentration of the triphosphate form of the inhibitor need to be considered as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      The different inhibition patterns observed with EBOV RdRp and MERS–CoV RdRp point to
subtle differences in the mechanism of action. Delayed chain termination could be based on
inhibitor-induced structural changes of the newly synthesized dsRNA that at some point
prevent a productive alignment of primer and incoming nucleotide,
      <italic>
       e.g.
      </italic>
      through primer/template repositioning (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">
       23
      </xref>
      ) or
backtracking mechanisms (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">
       24
      </xref>
      ). Enzyme-specific
interactions with the extended primer may likewise affect the continued extension of the
primer, which helps to explain variations in the site of RNA synthesis arrest.
     </p>
     <p>
      An open question that warrants further investigation is the role of the
3′–5′ exonuclease (nsp14) in susceptibility to RDV. It has previously
been reported that nucleotide analog inhibitors can be excised by the viral exonuclease
(
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
       14
      </xref>
      ). A murine hepatitis virus mutant lacking the
3′–5′ exonuclease activity was shown to be more sensitive to RDV (
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
       5
      </xref>
      ). However, given its high potency in cell-based assays,
RDV seems to be protected from excision at least to a certain degree. This protection could
be provided by the additional three nucleotide following the inhibitor. In contrast, classic
chain terminators would be readily accessible for excision. Taken together, this study
provides a likely mechanism of action for RDV against coronaviruses. The novel strategy for
the expression of MERS–CoV RdRp helps to guide the design of equivalent constructs of
related viruses, including SARS–CoV-2.
